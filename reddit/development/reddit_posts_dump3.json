    "title": "Dick Masterson and his comments regarding the Ukraine war",
    "content": "When the Ukraine war came up on this most recent episodes, Dick gave us his views on the war, and he essentially just repeated the official Kremlin propaganda talking points. So im making this post to address some of the things he said:\n\n***\"Luhansk and Donetsk dont want to be part of Ukraine because Ukraine is fucked... Those two areas want to be Russian, Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on Earth\"***\n\nWhen it comes to what people in those regions actually think, its a little difficult because polling has been difficult since 2014 for obvious reasons. I'm going to link research done by the Washington Post, they seem to have good methodology. To sum it up quickly: Opinions seem to be very divided on the matter. There certainly are elements of the population who would prefer to join Russia, but its certainly not as clearcut as Dick makes it out to be. \n\n [Do Ukrainians in the Donbas want to join Russia? - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/15/russia-ukraine-donbas-donetsk-luhansk-public-opinion/) \n\nThe more important matter here, is the manner in which elements of those two regions declared themselves independent. If any given country has an area that would like to join another country, you can do that via democratic self determination. You can try to find a compromise, war should only be a last resort in extreme cases. Even if a majority of the people in these regions wanted to join Russia, it does not give Russia the right to invade Ukraine and start a civil war in the country.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. Dick says that Zelensky is \"shelling people in the Donbas region\" which comes across as somewhat dishonest because he seems to be implying that the Russians invaded Ukraine to protect civilians in the Donbas. When in reality, Russian separatists started the war in 2014, with the aid of the Russian military, and thats when the Ukrainian government began shelling the area, as you usually do in wars. The shelling of Donbas came **after** the Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory in 2014. \n\nAlso about the corruption, Dick keeps repeating the line that Ukraine is incredibly corrupt, which is true, but so is Russia. In fact, Russia is consistently ranked as more corrupt than Ukraine:\n\n [2022 Corruption Perceptions Index: Explore the… - Transparency.org](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022) \n\n***\"The French sent the army in to defend us, that's what the special military operation was\" and \"Putin is defending the Luhansk and Donetsk regions\"***\n\nIm not even going to get into the comparison between the War for independence and the Ukraine war, but even if the two were perfectly analogous, we don't live in the 18th century anymore. The world has changed quite a bit since then, I would like to think that we don't conduct ourselves as we did in the 18th century, when nuclear weapons did not exist, when there was no international body like the UN, and when it was still normal for major powers to conquer each others territory. Believe it or not, but even within western Europe we have territorial disputes between countries, but we tend not to invade one another over it anymore.\n\nBut my main point here is that its very obvious that the Russians did not simply attempt to \"defend the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\" Even the most pro-Russian person must admit that it was very clear from the beginning what Russian intentions in this war were.\n\nWhy would Russian paratroopers try to secure key airfields in Kyiv? Why would the Russians try to encircle the capitol of Ukraine? Does anyone remember the giant Russian column heading for Kyiv that stretched from Prybirsk to Hostomel? They clearly intended to topple the Ukrainian Government in order to install a pro Russian puppet government. That's not what \"defending two regions\" looks like.\n\n***\"Zelensky is supported by the West to support that Coup government there\"***\n\nI don't know if Dick is implying that the Euromaidan uprising was a coup organized by the west, I would not be surprised if that's his position, but just to be clear, it was not organised or pushed by western governments. Obviously western governments prefer a pro-western government in Ukraine, but the protests and the overthrowing of the previous pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych were an organic reaction to the violent crackdown of pro-western protests in Ukraine. You dont need any conspiracy theories to explain this revolution, like himself Dick said many times, Ukraine was extremely corrupt at the time, it was also one of the poorest nations in Europe, despite its plenty natural resources. \n\nIts not exactly difficult to imagine why many Ukrainians would be pro-west and pro EU. As much as people like Dick like to make fun of the \"Globo Homo West\", most ex-eastern bloc nations desperately want to become part of the west because its significantly wealthier and offers a much higher quality of life than a country like Russia. Put yourself in the position of the average Ukrainian, do you want to be economically closer to Russia, an authoritarian nightmare regime with a GDP smaller than Italy's, or the western world, the region of the planet with the highest quality of life? When you don't have indoor plumbing and live off of 100 bucks a month, you tend not to worry too much about wokeness n the west, you generally just want a better life for yourself and your children. \n\n [What do Ukrainians think about the EU? | Clingendael](https://www.clingendael.org/publication/what-do-ukrainians-think-about-eu) \n\nThis is an entirely different topic, but im just gonna say, eastern Europeans have a very different view of the west. We like to complain about wokeness and cancelations in the US and Western Europe, but you would probably take that any day over \"cancel culture\" in Russia, where being cancelled means getting thrown out a window or poisoned by a soviet nerve agent if you dare oppose Putin publicly. \n\nOh and to be clear, I like Dick, he's funny, I want him to keep appearing on PKA in the future. I just think his takes on the Ukraine war are completely retarded, that's why I made this post :)",

    "title": "How Indian Public opinion on Ukraine war changed - A detailed analysis",
    "content": "I had written this as a comment in Europe subreddit. But then people liked it and wanted me to post here too. Hence this post.\n\nI am an Indian guy who has been interested in geopolitics and international relations for the past 15 years. I am very passionate about it and read news from around the world, thus I understand the sentiments across the world. I read Indian, American, British, Chinese, and Pakistani news on a daily basis, and a bit of European news occasionally. So, I believe I can give you a detailed response.\n\nBut I know this is a sensitive topic for many Europeans, and people tend to get emotional rather than logical, so read only if you are in the mood to read a rational opinion with an open mind, as it may not align with the general opinion in your media. I don't have a horse in this race.\n\nThe public sentiment in India was highly supportive of Ukraine when the war started. People were condemning Russia in all media. It was considered an unprovoked aggression, which most people were against. It was also seen as a large country invading a small country, thus the David and Goliath sentiment of supporting the underdog was seen everywhere.\n\nThen it slowly started to turn when videos started popping up on social media of Indian medical students being systematically racially discriminated against in Ukraine when they were trying to escape the country. Everywhere preferences were given to people of specific skin color.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# UN Votes\n\nThere were also scenes of Indians not being allowed to cross the border as some sort of bargaining chip. And a Ukrainian diplomat in the UN speaking in a language that can be considered undiplomatic when India asked for help to get her students out. The UN diplomat of Ukraine was talking in an uncaring manner in a way that can be misunderstood as purposefully keeping students as hostages to get Indian government support. At the same time, Russian diplomats were talking in a caring attentive way, and even said they would do the rescue from their side, which I don't know if it happened or not, but all these videos were watched by the public, and opinions can get formed from there.\n\nThen came the news of various western countries condemning India for abstaining and not voting against Russia in the UN. This is the same UN where 5 countries enjoy veto power to do whatever the heck they want. India does not have this veto power; thus, we had to always buy this power from someone.\n\nThe only reliable country that has consistently helped India with Veto is Russia. If we vote against them, they simply do not give a veto the next time we need it. And, if we assume one other country like France sells us their VETO usage rights, then without Russia, we will become dependent on a single entity, and as you know, a monopoly increases cost and reliance. If you want to see India vote independently in the UN against a country that gives veto to India, then you need to either remove this veto system or give veto to India.\n\nAnyway, then there was social media outrage against India by many Europeans and Americans. And this is when the opinion really started to change in India from \"full support to Ukraine\" to \"indifference\" as it felt like western powers were forcing India, and no one likes to be lectured to.\n\nEven on Reddit, under every post about India, there would be comments like \"sanction India\" and much worse things, and slowly these things started to make people think \"maybe there is a different side of the story.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hypocrisy\n\nThen active social media people started doing their research, and facts about Ukraine-India relations started popping up. Ukraine's support to Pakistan in Kargil war against India in 1999. Ukraine's supply of weapons, including tanks to Pakistan etc.\n\nA few weeks ago, Ukraine's Chair of Committee on Foreign Policy *Oleksandr Merezhko* suggested the imposition of sanctions on India during his visit to the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese things change opinions, and people have gone from \"Oh no, slava Ukraine\" to \"Yet another US-Russia proxy war\". How is this any different from the Iraq war, Vietnam war, or the ongoing Yemen war?\n\nThe hypocrisy of the participating countries is what hurts the most. Azerbaijan is invading Armenia, and none of these countries are helping Armenia, where extreme cruelty to Armenian civilians and soldiers is happening against the Geneva Convention. Instead, they are supporting Azerbaijan and buying their oil and gas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Basic Diplomacy failure\n\nInternational relations have always been about big powerful countries bullying smaller countries for thousands of years. Those with power rule, and others obey. When they don't obey or change allegiance, there is a war. This is not at all fair, but it is reality.\n\nWhen Cuba wanted to keep some missiles, it was the Cuban Missile Crisis and deserved to be invaded. But when Ukraine, which is literally bordering Russia on flat plains, wants to keep the entire NATO force within striking range of Moscow, it is not a crisis?\n\nThe reality is that Ukraine's politicians are dumb or have been bought out by foreign powers to act dumb. They have never acted in the best interest of their country. All they needed to do was to play the politics of small to medium countries and play the neutral double game trying to win favors from both Russia and the West. This is what all countries of that power range do.\n\nIn this particular case, the Russian demand was that they do not join NATO. They could have agreed to it. And then Russia would have looked dumb and would not have invaded. Now, wait 7-10 years until either Putin dies or new power comes, then at an opportune time when Russia is weak, join NATO. This is what any sensible small to medium country would do.\n\nWas it worth going into direct war for this simple statement? Or playing politics for 10 years and doing it at the right time?\n\nThere were a lot of chances to prevent this war, but no one seemed interested. And no one really cares about the people of Ukraine. It has always been about the political powers fighting each other for other reasons, and this is what hurts me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Winners and Losers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Loser #1\n\nThe biggest loser of this war is Ukraine obviously. 18 million people fled the country out of a population of 43 million. Many of them will never return, a few million returned, 5 million is refugee in Europe. The remaining staying back in Ukraine are majorly male-population who was banned from leaving, the elderly and the poor. Even if the war gets over in the favour of Ukraine, it is doomed for the next century with that kind of population decline.\n\nAt least 100,000 of their soldiers either got killed or got severely injured. And most of their military equipment is lost, and new equipment is brought from foreign countries on loan. Many of the cities have become unlivable. They lost an estimated $349 Billion worth of infrastructure, and potentially trillions of dollars in long-term loss over the next few decades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Loser #2\n\nThe second biggest loser is Russia. They lost their international reputation. One of their main exports were weapons and buyers have now lost confidence in their weapons, which will potentially cost them 100s of billions in future loss. They also have to sell their family jewel of top secret technologies that very few countries have knowledge of to make any further weapon sales. They also got isolated internationally with sanctions and trade problems everywhere.\n\nAt least 100,000 of their soldiers either got killed or got severely injured. They lost large amount of their huge stockpile of accumulated weapons they had from 1960s. And their threat factor thus lost influence in many places.\n\nTheir neighbouring countries like Finaland and Sweden who has usually stayed neutral is now applying for NATO and they are now geopolitically surrounded by NATO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Loser #3\n\nThe third biggest loser is pretty much all countries in Europe. Their currency fell massively, they became dependent  on America, their industries lost competitiveness and they are forced to spend billions in defence. I will keep it short here as I have mentioned more points below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Losers\n\nThe fourth biggest losers are small countries with weak economies like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Srilanka, Ghana, Suriname and most African countries. All of them are in deep trouble due to sudden inflation and high price of oil/gas. And literally every country in the world is struggling with inflation and high oil prices!\n\nThe fifth biggest loser is India and China. Even though we have been able to buy oil and stabilize a bit, but still our oil price increased massively over past 3 years. There is inflation increase too. And now with weakened Russia, it has become dependent on China, which is bad for India to have its arm supplier starting to become a puppet of China in the future.\n\nEven though China got this advantage, their benefit is negated by the fact that now every country is spending billions in defence, thus once sleepy countries are now becoming defence powers, thus forcing China to increase their defence too. Europe, Japan, Australia, South East Asian countries, All of them have made their highest defence budget in past 50+ years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Winners\n\nThe **second** biggest winner are the Oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia who was facing fund crunch due to their massive construction projects. Now they can sell oil for a premium price. Do you know how they do that? They simply REDUCE oil production, and since they ask all producers to increase price. This is a real cartel that the entire world accepts because of our next winner.\n\nThe biggest winner of this war is America. During Covid, America printed trillions of dollars and handed them out to people and businesses as support. Now, if any country printed money like that, it would cause high inflation. But America is an exception since their currency is used around the world. So their inflation gets exported to everyone around the world.\n\nBut even better, do you know what rich investors do when there is a global crisis? They panic and convert their wealth to gold and dollars as they are considered safe. Out of this, Dollar is their main choice as it is more liquid. Thus, it is possible to not only export inflation to other countries but also profit from it. And just like that during the Ukraine war, wealthy people and companies around the world converted their money to USD. Thus, instead of the US experiencing inflation, their currency bloomed while all other currencies went down. This is the primary reason why your currency fell, no matter which country you live in.\n\n**Secondly**, NATO was an alliance that most countries, who are part of it, took for granted, such as not buying the required percentage of GDP as weapons mandated in the NATO agreement. It was an alliance made in 1950s against a threat that no longer exists, thus NATO was an alliance without a purpose since dissolution of USSR in 1991. Thirty years without a purpose was making countries starting to think about even leaving this.\n\nThere was even an attempt by Europe to form its own alliance or common European military. This war not only made all these countries take NATO seriously, but they also increased their military budget by a huge percentage. And who are they going to buy at least a good amount of those weapons from?\n\n**Thirdly**, Germany was starting to play an influential role in Europe independent of what the US wants, and the Euro was becoming a prominent international trade currency. Europeans had even started to dictate rules to American companies like forcing Apple to make USB-C mandatory, or Fining Google $4billion dollar. How dare you fine an American company?\n\nThis influence EU gained in past few years has now been reduced. Apart from that, the industries in Europe has now been crippled by higher energy prices and taxes to fund the additional defence expense. This is why initially Germany was so reluctant to get involved as German politicians knew all of these.\n\n**Fourthly**, globally, for most countries, the weapon choice historically has been either American or Soviet. Now, all these countries can't choose Russian weapons due to sanctions and also the reputation of Russian weapons has gone down among general public after seeing their real performance in a war.\n\n**Fifthly**, people were making fun of American military for their loss in Afghanistan. And they had become the butt of all memes, but more importantly, American military complex needed a new war to continue their growth.\n\n**Sixthly and most importantly**, the reason why the dollar is the main trade currency of the world is that the US has forced all oil-selling countries to sell oil in dollars only. They are not even allowed to sell in their own currency like Riyal or Dinnar. If a country tries to sell oil in any other currency, they either get invaded, sanctioned, or a civil war happens. So, the root of dollar supremacy is oil, and the US controls this to the maximum.\n\nThe only country that the US had no control over that was selling oil is Russia. Now that is also highly restricted. Venunzula is sanctioned and in civil war. Iran is sanctioned. Yemen is in war. Iraq was invaded and now in shambles. Libya is in civil war. All other countries that sell oil are part of OPEC cartel except for a few like Norway but they are anyway subservient to US needs.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the US does not need oil from other countries. The US is pretty self-sufficient now in oil. But the only issue is that this oil is more expensive to extract than it is in oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia or Iran. So, increasing oil prices are good for the US as it makes their oil production profitable. And this is also an American gift to oil producing countries who sell oil in American terms, that is, SELL ONLY IN DOLLAR.\n\nThe reason every country including Russia/Iran/China/N.Korea is forced to sell anything and everything in dollars is because of oil being sold in dollar. Now, every country that does not have oil have to earn dollar. And the main way to do that is by selling their exports in dollars. Then they can use this to buy oil in dollar. As long as dollar is the supreme currency, US do not have to worry about money at all as they can print it as much as they want whenever they need, ofcourse to a very high limit. Its like free money, but paid by everyone except america.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis war made Europeans once again fully dependent on America, instead of a Europe that had slowly started to become a competitor of America. This decreased the wealth of Europe while increasing that of America. The game played by America is so good here that it won in every way possible without firing a single bullet. And their real opponents are cheering for them and not even realizing they have been conned! What a genius play!\n\nAnd historically, America became America because of the two world wars that destroyed the entire world but made America rich as it propped up lot of industries to make weapons and sell it to Europe. And ultimately this allowed them to set dollar as the international currency. This war is mere duplication of that American success for the third time.\n\nThe European politicians know this, and this is why powerful countries like Germany and France were hesitant at first in joining the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n\nBut democracy is such that it can be manipulated to great extent using media and thus politicians can't do anything, and here no manipulation is even necessary, because common people know *war is bad, invader is bad, Hitler is bad, putin is hitler*. Look at even the first address of US about the Ukraine war, and you will see American president repeatedly say \"Putin's war\" instead of \"Russia-Ukraine war\". And you will see this word gets repeated everywhere. This is just one of the examples of how world powers continue to dominate the world.\n\nIf the majority of people could learn and analyze situations to this depth, Europeans will be deeply upset at US for playing this sneaky game against them indirectly. This is the actual game, and it didn't sour relations, did it? The only politicians in Europe who had the capability to see and play this game were authoritarian ones who did play disregarding public opinion for their own benefits, like Turkey trying to gain some benefit out of this, but they too were not powerful enough to go against this kindof master-play by US.\n\n\\------\n\n*This entire post was written from my memory, exclusively from my understanding of how the world works based on what I have read and experienced over the past 15 years, as this was meant to be a comment and not a post, but accidently it became a bit too long as I kept typing. Thus, apart from checking a few numbers like how much dollars loss Ukraine had, I did not reference any source for this analysis, which is why I have not provided any reference links, but you can verify the authenticity of my claims yourself. I am confident in its correctness, but if I made any mistakes you can point them out.*",

However, the media giving this war so much attention but not the other conflicts going on right now bothers me.\n\nWe had a school assembly today talking about the Ukraine war. Not once have I heard anyone speak out against the Syrian Gov, Israel or America for invading Iraq. I find it quite ridiculous and sad that we live in a world where you only matter if you’re white. I want to see Afghan, Iraqi and Palestinian flags waving across London, not just Ukraine.\n\nThe west has continued to support Ukraine while we’ve left Afghanistan and Syria defenceless spending more money than anyone could even think off. The media showing western bias, not once have I seen an article against Israel or America, not one single time.",

But by his logic Russia can invade whoever it feels like invading since we don't want to upset them into using nuclear weapons. Will we stop them when they try for latvia? Lithuania? \n\nAlso JP has himself mentioned the holodomor many times through out his lectures. He knows the hell that Ukrainians were put through under Stalin. He expects them to negotiate with the country that did these things to them and now invaded them unprovoked? To their ancestors?",
