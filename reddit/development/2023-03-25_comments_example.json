They have suffered some stunning defeats and none of the deadlines (capture Donezk oblast by 15 September 2022) have been met. \nPolitically this war was also extremely costly as the failure to achieve a quick victory effectively reduced Russia from the status of a great power to a regional power with nukes, but with perhaps 10% of the political leverage Russia had before the war.\nThe war has turned into an existential crisis for Russia. And each day that passes without victory for Russia further deteriorates their position. \n\nAll of this could have been avoided if Russia had secured a quick victory - which they were unable to. The \"Russia withholds it's good stuff\" theory implies that they could have won the war quickly but didn't want to, which makes little sense given the enormous military, political, and economical cost of their military blunders.\nPortraying themselves as the strongest military in Europe had always been the central part of russian defense strategy. Other people thinking that Russia was an invincible behemoth of the battlefield war always the most valuable deterrence Russia had. Their catastrophic failure in Ukraine destroyed that image.\n\nNo.\nWhat we're seeing is peak Russia. \n\nThere are no warehouses with thousands of modern, well maintained tanks. There are no swarms of thousands of secret wonder weapons waiting to be unleashed. There are no secret ammo stockpiles which they reserve for a future conflict that is extremely unlikely to happen within the next 100 years.\n\nThat isn't to say that they sent all the best stuff to Ukraine either. Of course they're keeping reserves. But these reserves are not \"the real army\", Hidden for a \"real\" conflict.\n\nThis war is the real conflict. Russia cannot afford to lose it now (they could do so in march or April last year). So presuming that they withhold large quantities of better quality weapons while losing a war against a (presumed) non-peer military in the lime-light if the world stage does not make sense.",

Then all the resulting deaths after 2003 which were caught in the middle of the civil war, or the ethnic cleaning operations by ISIS or other Sunni or Shia militias. The death toll was never about how many the US directly killed due to bombings or whatever, it was everyone who died as a result of the war. \n\nI spent two years in Iraq, mainly in the greater Baghdad area. As far as shock and awe goes, dumb people like Hasan literally think the US was like dumping bombs all over Baghdad like Dresden or some shit. In reality all shock and awe was taking out both military and government targets. I saw entire Iraqi Army military bases reduced to rubble. I also stayed in buildings taken out by \u201csmart bombs\u201d - the building itself was half destroyed. But every building around it was mainly untouched minus windows blown out. \n\nAgain, these were mainly military targets. But there were missiles that hit civilian buildings, but that wasn\u2019t widespread. Usually a bad missile, mis-ID\u2019d target, etc. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is, Shock and Awe wasn\u2019t some civilian bloodbath like Hasan claims. \n\nCivilians were killed in shock and awe, but most civilians were killed in the resulting civil war after the initial invasion. That\u2019s where things got ugly and brutal. \n\nIt was like everyone was fighting everyone else, and alot of civilians got caught in the middle. US military against a Shia militia, Shia militia fighting Shia militia. Sunni militia fighting Shia militia. US against Sunni Militia. The Al Qaeda affiliated groups against everyone. Everyone was getting killed. \n\nThen there was the ISIS take over of Mosul and north Iraq. That killed a lot of civilians. And that\u2019s part of the overall civilian death count. \n\nAnyway, my main point is, Hasan has no clue what the fuck he\u2019s talking about, and his claim that Russia is somehow not as bad as the US is absurd. Russia is literally destroying entire cities. Cities of 200,000 people. 80,000 people, intentionally wiped out. It\u2019s their entire war strategy to just erase entire cities off the map. Also their genocidal rhetoric kinda goes along with their genocidal actions. \n\nThe 2003 Iraq war is extremely depressing. It makes me sick that it ever happened. No civilian should have been killed. But Hasan is a dumbfuck.",

All of the current issues have just been a continuation of the struggle between those who wanted to move away from russia and those who still had an affinity towards russia. \n\nDon't put to much stock in the vote that most people in Crimea wanted to be annexed. That vote was take after occupation. That doesn't mean that lots of people in Crimea were not in favor of Russia. The eastern part of Ukraine was always more pro-russian and Crimea actually belonged to russia prior to them giving it to Ukraine in 1954. There has been a long history between the two countries and lots of russians living in ukraine. \n\nPrior to the current conflict, Ukraine stated they were a long way from joining NATO, if ever. In peace talks in the first month of the war Ukraine offered to never join NATO. It was certainly not an immediate possibility that required an invasion and Russia didn't take them up on the offer.\n\nIronically, the war has greatly shifted many ukrainians from being mixed between russia and the west to being solidly pro-west and would certainly now welcome being in NATO for future safety reasons. They can not join NATO now because you can't be a nation in conflict as one of the requirements for joining, however, depending on how the war ends, its probably increased the chances that whatever part of ukraine is not negotiated away will join NATO in the future.\n\nI would say the situation with Japan was not exactly the same situation but somewhat similar. US wasn't sanctioning russia prior to the war and were sanctioning japan because they were actively attacking china and others in an attempt to form an empire. One major difference is that former soviet republics wanted to join NATO for protection against Russia. The similarities would be that in both cases the US would be to thwart an expansion of empire and in both cases the other country decided to act to counter the US actions. The impact on Japan was more of an immediate threat to their expansion while the issues for Russia were way less immediate. Having NATO on their doorstep obviously would not be desirable for Russia but wasn't nearly as imperative as cutting japan off from the natural resources they needed.",

And make no mistake about it, as far as the Russian government and Putin's personal views on the subject go, Ukrainians don't exist, and they're just people too stubborn to admit they're actually Russians. Immediately after the war started, there was even a shockingly open editorial in RIA Novosti frankly explaining that this is what the technical definition of nazism is for this purpose, and that 'denazification' of Ukraine is effectively just re-educating the people there to understand that they are Russians. \n\nSo it doesn't matter that Ukraine is not some sort of beacon of democracy.

    "content": "DNIPRO, Ukraine\u2014One Ukrainian paid almost $10,000 to flee the draft. Another has ignored five military summonses. A third avoids public spaces, fearing a military official will pounce and issue a call-up.  \nAfter a year of war, Ukraine is facing increasing challenges in raising the troops it needs to resist Russian forces and eject them from its territory.  \nWhen Russia invaded in February last year, thousands of volunteers lined up outside military recruitment centers. With many of them now dead or injured, Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to recruit replacements, often drafting those who have neither the desire nor the training to serve. The result is a growing number of fighting-age men who are attempting to evade service.\n\nSo far, Ukraine has managed to replenish its ranks regularly, and has largely succeeded in holding back a monthslong Russian onslaught in the east as it awaits an influx of tens of thousands of fresh troops, many of them trained in the West, to drive its planned spring offensive.\n\nBut while polls show that support for the defense effort remains high, the stock of willing volunteers now appears to be dwindling. Ukraine\u2019s population is less than one-third the size of Russia\u2019s, not accounting for the exodus of millions since the war began, and the kind of coercion used in Russia\u2019s authoritarian system isn\u2019t an option, Kyiv says.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do as Russia does and drive people to war with batons,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in February, three days after he renewed a decree on mobilization that makes reservists and most healthy men of fighting age eligible for call-up, in place since the war started. He said evasion of military service was a serious issue for Ukraine.\n\nThe war has ravaged the professional armies of both Ukraine and Russia. Moscow responded last September with a mobilization of more than 300,000 men, and President Vladimir Putin has told Russians to prepare for a protracted war.  \nUkraine had a standing army of 260,000 when Russia invaded, and around 100,000 have been killed or wounded since then, according to Western estimates. The military banked until recently on patriotic fervor to swell those ranks. TV ads call on people to sign up and \u201cdefend what\u2019s yours,\u201d and billboards promote the Interior Ministry\u2019s new Offensive Guard, with brigades named Anger and Spartan, and slogans urging reservists and experienced troops to \u201cturn your rage into firepower.\u201d  \nAlongside the recruitment campaigns, Ukraine is increasingly relying on enlistment officers in military uniform handing out summonses in public spaces. The Security Service of Ukraine, the country\u2019s domestic security and intelligence agency, said this month that it had closed down 26 Telegram channels that had been posting the locations and times where they were active.",

You need to stay out of range of the enemy and clear your way forward. If Russia invades today, the Swedes are going to pull their air fleet way way back to where they are safe, and slowly chip away at the enemy from there.\n\nThat's why they also have tankers and AWACS systems, that is why they have been training with NATO and with their neighbours since forever. Hell, they literally just announced that they are joining their air forces together with those Scandinavian neighbours.\n\nThey need that large net around them to work in - you are not holding out in the world of BVR combat when no place in your country is more than 150 km from the edge of that net.

Individual soldiers, or even officers, are not expected to judge the legality of the war itself, and can not be found guilty of following orders to wage a war, even if the war is illegal.\n\nI wouldn't be so sure about that one - a lot of international law got re-interpreted in the last two decades, and as a result Germany successfully prosecuted several surviving people assisting Nazi war crimes back then. As most crimes have reached the statue of limitations currently only complicity to murder is prosecuted - for people who before were seen as not expected to judge the legality of their tasks (like the secretary to a concentration camp commander). Without the statue of limitations issue a lot of soldiers could've been prosecuted with the current interpretation, though.\n\nI don't expect individual soldiers to be prosecuted just for being part of the war, though, as dealing with all the other crimes will already take ages. I wouldn't be surprised for Russians having to prove they were not part of the invasion for acquiring a Visa to some parts of the world once this is over, though.\n\n> None of the major wars since WW2 (Korea, Vietnam, Soviet-Afghan, Iraq-Iran, US-Afghan, US-Iraq, etc.) have been declared. Many have been illegal based on various interpretations of legality, but it's ludicrous to claim that every single soldier participating in these wars on the invader's side is a war criminal simply because the war they fought in was undeclared.\n\nYou'll need to separate pre/post 9/11 wars here, as that's where interpretations of international law changed. Also we have the main force being the US here, with the Hague invasion act, and a bunch of other countries that typically would look into starting investigations being complicit. \n\nThis also might be another reason why we won't see prosecution of ordinary soldiers - it'd set a precedent and could potentially open up soldiers involved in Iraq and Afghanistan to prosecution. \n\nIf a war is illegal or not depends mainly on UN definition, if it's undeclared or not doesn't play much of a role.",

    "content": "There will always be exceptions among millions of people, but generally:  \nOur feeling is a feeling of repulsion at Russia's aggressiveness towards a country that simply wants to independently choose its own friends and its own future. While neither NATO nor Ukraine are perfect, at the end of the day this comes down to Russia realizing that few people who have belonged to Russia's sphere of influence in the past want to remain there if given the choice. Russia also knows that creating border conflicts effectively rules out NATO membership. There is broad support here for supporting Ukraine for as long as is necessary. Pretty much all our support packages, both humanitarian and military, have broad support in parliament. This also reassures Ukraine that even a change in government here does not mean any risk of Norway withdrawing its support. Absolutely all my friends and family are entirely pro-Ukraine in this war, and I am very happy that my tax money goes towards aiding Ukraine in its struggle. Support for sending more and more powerful weapons is also just increasing, both because Russia's war crimes are increasing too and because drunk Medvedev's incoherent ramblings about total war have no credibility anymore.\n\nThere is little internal tension about our approach. What there is, though, is some worry about the long-term effects of this war on our relationship with Russia, who will continue to be our neighbor. But there is very little fear of direct hostilities. Russian sabotage on Norwegian soil is an ongoing threat, and we know that Russian intelligence activity has increased. But the fear of Russia going into open warfare against a NATO country is pretty much non-existent, and we're not scared of something bad happening to us personally. Russia has no casus belli, there is no significant Russian presence here for Russia to fake having to protect, and their military is severely weakened. They have clearly demonstrated to the world that they are no longer a military superpower, just a paper tiger, and a full-scale war against NATO can only end badly for Russia. With their nuclear arms they can inflict pretty much total damage on us as well, but that would mean the end of Russia, and any war between NATO and Russia without nuclear weapons will be won easily by NATO. The Russian authorities also know, even if they will never publicly admit it, that there is not a single NATO country that wants to cross the border into Russian territory and take a single square metre of their country.\n\nIn the areas bordering Russia, the cross-border relationship has generally been better than the relationship on the national level, in part due to the Soviet Union's assistance (which of course also included many Ukrainians) in our liberation during WW2. They came, they liberated and they left again, for which we are thankful. The relationship at the border has *mostly* been pretty good and calm, despite belonging to opposite blocs. So while most people even in the border areas agree that we had to cut off most ties now, they are probably more saddened by it than the rest of Norway. And more worried for what the relationship will be like after this. Still, that issue pales in comparison to the brutality on the ground in Ukraine, and Norwegians at the border are also appalled that Russians they have been on friendly terms and co-operated with for a long time now suddently support and/or deny Russia's extensive war crimes. The Svalbard archipelago also has a significant Russian presence, and that's a bit complicated, even though the Russians and the Norwegians living there generally live in different areas. So there is uncertainty about our relationship, but not fear for our safety, and we will support Ukraine regardless.\n\nSupport for NATO has been high in Norway before this war, but it has still increased significantly because of the war. The Socialist Left Party, which has a confidence-and-supply relationship with the current government, has also reversed its position of advocating for Norway to leave NATO. Now only the far-left Red Party wants to leave, and even they have absolutely no intention of bringing up the subject. It's not really been a hot issue before this either, the vast majority wants to remain, but now leaving is absolutely unthinkable. Us being in NATO helps a lot, and we are also very happy that Sweden and Finland will seemingly join over the coming months.",

More recently, I have heard people report an increase in these type of dreams surrounding major catastrophes such as 9/11, or the hurricane destruction of New Orleans (both off which I had intense dreams about beforehand).\n\nOf course, when looking at dreams like this it\u2019s hard to say what is actually \u201cprophetic\u201d and what is just extrapolated dread/projected anxiety. Dreams do take what we know and are interested in and defamiliarize them from the context of memory and history to run simulations about possible future responses. If, for instance, you are someone who pays any attention to the news, or to wars in general, or who consumes any media in which warfare plays a part, or have any emotional feelings about these topics, then it\u2019s perfectly natural that you could have dreamt this.",
