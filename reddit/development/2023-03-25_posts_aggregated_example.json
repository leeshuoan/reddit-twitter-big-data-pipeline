Her grandmother basically made her hate Ukrainians with a passion, due to the 1919 war and other border clashes between the two countries in the past. Today I was on a FaceTime with her, and I just talked a bit about the war because it hits close to home. She starts talking about how Ukraine isn\u2019t a country, how they only take, and other stereotypes and straight up Russian propaganda. She has 0 fucking clue about any of Ukraine\u2019s history and what we as a nation have been through. This is truly making me consider our future, so I need some advice desperately. I\u2019m thinking of ending things with her, just need some advice urgently. Thanks.",

    "content": "Gee, I sure hope this isn\u2019t one of those topics that the automod auto-deletes because of too many people asking about it anymore. \n\nAnyways, my dad has been making the point that Russia would have never gone through with a full invasion of Ukraine if there hadn\u2019t been the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO. \n\nHe says that they annexed Crimea because most people living in Crimea wanted to be annexed (or at least not be part of Ukraine) and between that and 2021 it was all quiet on the (eastern) front. Until the west started floating the idea of Ukraine joining NATO. \n\nI don\u2019t really know if he\u2019s right or not, most resources that I can find talk about how Russia has wanted Ukraine since before Crimea, and that the war that is now happening has actually been technically ongoing since then or possibly before. \n\nI do remember hearing about the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO at some point, but I can\u2019t remember if that was before or after Russia invaded. \n\nI just want to get to the bottom of this so I can know whether my comparison between the current situation of sending weapons to Ukraine and sanctioning Russia and the US treatment of Japan prior to Pearl Harbor holds any weight. If Russia only attacked Ukraine because of the possibility of it becoming NATO, that puts a hole in my comparison.",

The EHT team used sophisticated algorithms and techniques to process the data from the telescopes and create a high-resolution image of the black hole's event horizon, the point of no return for anything falling into it. The image revealed details about the black hole's size, shape, spin, and surrounding environment.\n\n    \tThe NASA-DARPA team realized that they could use similar methods to detect stealth bombers by their effects on the light and space-time around them. They developed a prototype sensor system that consists of a constellation of satellites equipped with X-ray telescopes and gravitational wave detectors. The satellites scan the sky for any anomalies in the X-ray or gravitational wave signals that could indicate the presence of a stealth bomber. The data from the satellites is then sent to a ground station, where it is analyzed by powerful computers and artificial intelligence.\n    \tThe sensor system is ready for testing, but there is a problem: the team needs a target to test it on. They decide to use one of their own stealth bombers, the B-21 Raider, as a test subject. They secretly arrange for a B-21 to fly over a remote area in Nevada, where they have set up a temporary observation post. They hope to prove that their sensor system can detect and track the B-21 without alerting it or anyone else.\n    \tHowever, things go wrong when they discover that another stealth bomber is flying in the same area: a Chinese H-20, which has infiltrated US airspace undetected. The H-20 is on a mission to destroy a secret military facility in Nevada that houses a prototype hypersonic weapon. The NASA-DARPA team realizes that they have a rare opportunity to test their sensor system on an enemy stealth bomber and possibly prevent an attack on US soil. They decide to take the risk and activate their sensor system.\n    \tThe sensor system works as expected and detects both stealth bombers by their gravitational and radiation signatures. The team is able to identify the H-20 as an enemy aircraft and alert the US Air Force, which scrambles fighter jets to intercept it. The B-21 is also detected by the sensor system, but it is recognized as a friendly aircraft and ignored by the US Air Force. However, the B-21 pilot notices that he is being tracked by an unknown source and suspects that he has been compromised. He aborts his test flight and returns to base.\n    \tThe US Air Force manages to shoot down the H-20 before it can reach its target. The NASA-DARPA team celebrates their success and reports their findings to their superiors. They are praised for their innovation and courage and awarded with funding and resources to continue their project. They hope that their sensor system will give the US an edge in the war and help end it peacefully.\n    \tThe story ends with a twist: it is revealed that the B-21 pilot was actually a Chinese spy who had infiltrated the US Air Force and was planning to sabotage the NASA-DARPA project. He had used his position as a test pilot to gain access to the B-21 and plant a device that would transmit its location and status to China. He had also arranged for the H-20 to fly over Nevada as a diversion and a backup plan in case his device failed. His goal was to expose and destroy the NASA-DARPA sensor system before it could be deployed against China.\n    \tHowever, his plan backfired when he realized that his device was not working properly and that he was being tracked by an unknown source. He assumed that it was China trying to contact him, but it was actually the NASA-DARPA sensor system detecting him by his gravitational and radiation signatures. He tried to escape but was too late. He was captured by US authorities and interrogated. He confessed his identity and his mission and revealed that China had more spies in the US military and government who were working to undermine US \n    war efforts.",

In an interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, he once again complained about the lack of Western weapons, noting that this is the reason why Kiev allegedly cannot launch the spring offensive. \n\nZelensky is obviously lying. By the way, over the past month, the West has handed over some $24.7 billion for Kiev's planned spring offensive. One of the largest sums was expectedly poured in by the Pentagon - $4 billion. It is also known that by mid-April the Ukrainian fighters will receive almost all of the weapons promised by the West.\n\nWhat a waste!!! And how much more is to come! By raising much smaller amounts, we will help the Russian troops stop this sweat of billions for the war. Better to spend that money on hospitals, education, and railroads after all!",

It is a well-known international video game company based in Europe partly owned by Playrix, which strives to introduce the joy of core gaming experiences to casual players. It\u2019s the creator of the famous Hero Wars franchise (**50M+** installs on Android) and other hits such as Throne Rush and Chibi Island.\n\nIn 2022, the firm also acquired the well-known Pixel Gun 3D game (**100M+** downloads on Google Play app store alone) from Cubic Games, and acquired 2 other studios, Royal Ark and RJ Games.\n\nIt also bolsters a program for junior game developers called Dragon Machines and has an upcoming game called Mount Royale.\n\nIt\u2019s currently rated as one of the top-3 developers in Europe with **200+ millions** game installs worldwide with hit games like Hero Wars, Throne Rush, Chibi Island and others.\n\nPocketGamer.biz summed up the results of investments in the global game development for the whole 2022 and placed Nexters in 9th place in the Top 10 largest strategic investors!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7b67e5678vpa1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a328f34a42d4c6efef323d7540926fc8a3d8e88\n\nNexters story dates back to 2010 when the future friends and founders of Nexters first met. Those days Andrey Fadeev (Nexters\u2019 current CEO) was running a social games development studio, and Boris Gertsovskiy was shaping his plans on starting a game business. Their first game was Throne Rush and then came Hero Wars\n\nAs previously stated, Nexters acquired 3 new studios in 2022: Cubic Games, RJ Games and Royal Ark to accelerate their product growth strategy. With the games from the studios, they expect to enlarge Nexters player base, enter new genres, and significantly cement their presence in midcore as the leading segment of mobile gaming. The acquired games are the following (per press-release):\n\n* *Published by Cubic Games, Pixel Gun 3D is the world\u2019s No. 3 mobile first-person shooter by monthly audience with more than 170 mln of cumulative downloads.*\n* *Puzzle Breakers by RJ Games will provide an opportunity to gain a significant position in the sizable segment of the puzzle RPG genre thanks to the game\u2019s high-quality art and engaging core gameplay.*\n* *Royal Ark\u2019s survival RPG titles Dawn of Zombies and Shelter Wars (developed by Game Gears team) will diversify Nexters\u2019 portfolio with games in a growing zombie setting and contribute to accumulating expertise in new genres and niches for the company.*\n\nNexters also launched the Dragon Machine program (previously called Boost). Its aim is to help smaller game developers by providing the funding and expertise needed to release new games and build successful businesses. They currently have a new RPG multiplayer online game in the pipeline called \u201cMount Royale\u201d [https://dragon-machines.com/en/games/mount-royale](https://dragon-machines.com/en/games/mount-royale)\n\n**Playrix Entertainment**\n\nIn 2022 Playrix became the #1 mobile game publisher in Europe. Playrix Holding Ltd., also known as Playrix Entertainment and Playrix Games, is a developer of free-to-play mobile games behind titles such as *Township*, *Fishdom*, *Homescapes*, and *Gardenscapes*. The company was founded in 2004 by Dmitry Bukhman and Igor Bukhman in Vologda, Russia, and moved its headquarters to Dublin, Ireland in 2013.\n\n[https://playrix.com/company/history](https://playrix.com/company/history)\n\nPlayrix was valued at $8 billion in 2021.\\[4\\] As of 2022, Playrix was the fourth-biggest mobile game developer in the world in terms of revenue and employed 4,000 people across 100 cities, mainly in Eastern Europe, including 1500 in Russia and 1500 in Ukraine. In October 2022, the company said it was ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine (source: Wikipedia)\n\nPlayrix owns 38% of Nexters. Playrix is purportedly also in talks to acquire Rovio\u2019s \u201cAngry Birds\u201d:\n\n[https://mobile.twitter.com/AB\\_\\_Network/status/1638588049993998353](https://mobile.twitter.com/AB__Network/status/1638588049993998353)\n\n**War in Ukrain**\n\nDue to the events of the war in Ukraine, shares of Nexters were halted on February 28th 2022 on NASDAQ, though the company is mainly based in Cyprus with many game dev. studios scattered around Europe. Given its original Russian roots dating back to 2010, the company seemed to have gotten caught up in the storm.\n\nDue to those circumstances, the company decided to relocate all of its remaining personnel in Russia and Ukraine to mainly Cyprus, and others to Armenia, Georgia and certain other \u201csafe- harbor\u201d countries.\n\nThe company divested all of its Moscow based offices and as of November 2022, Nexters had completely exited Russia. They even made a video about the relocation of the remaining employees on their FB page [https://fb.gg/v/juynqW3z7H/](https://fb.gg/v/juynqW3z7H/)\n\nIn 2023 NASDAQ completely cleared Nexters and the shares resumed trading again.\n\n**Changes to Corporate Governance**\n\nThe company also overhauled its board of directors and made many positive changes to its corporate governance. Ivan Tavrin left the Board and the position of Chairman of the Board, and is no longer involved in the corporate governance, management or operation of the Company. Bukhman brothers (Playrix) and Boris Gertsovskiy resigned as directors of the Board, while remaining major shareholders and participating in the Company\u2019s operations on the advising and management levels, respectively.\n\nNatasha Braginsky Mounier was elected as Chairperson of the Board of Directors, replacing Ivan Tavrin.\n\nThe new composition of Nexters\u2019 Board of Directors committees is as follows per the website [https://investor.nexters.com/governance/board-of-directions](https://investor.nexters.com/governance/board-of-directions)\n\n* *Sergei Zaitsev as non-Executive Director: Currently Sergei serves as an Investment Director at Everix Investments, an investment firm focusing on investments into high growth tech and media businesses.*\n* *Marie Holive: Marie has over 20 years of experience of finance and audit expertise in the media, tech, and healthcare, including Senior Audit Manager, Chief Financial Officer and Managing Director roles at such companies as General Electric and Comcast NBCUniversal.*\n* *Natasha Braginsky Mounier : Over 20 years at Capital Group, where she was investing in international equities and was the first ESG director.

The following financial figures and statements have been directly pulled from their official financial results which can be found here:  [https://investor.nexters.com/press-releases/financial-results-2022-Q3](https://investor.nexters.com/press-releases/financial-results-2022-Q3)\n\nQ4 2022 earnings should be out soon with an accompanying earning\u2019s call (date TBD)\n\nThird Quarter 2022 highlights (from press-release):\n\n* *Quarterly revenues of $125 million, growing 8% year-over-year*\n* *Net income for the third quarter of 2022 of $31 million vs. net losses of $104 million in the respective period of 2021*\n* *Adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to the $14 million in the respective period of 2021*\n* *\u0421ash flow generated from operating activities of $60 million for the third quarter of 2022 growing 17% year-over-year*\n\nFirst nine months and Third quarter 2022 financial performance in comparison\n\n[Q3 highlights](https://preview.redd.it/hvn2xfoe8vpa1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14cbd198ae15046be1f394ba02066e206dfbf8af)\n\nThe following section in italics is directly pulled from the Q3 press release:\n\n*\u201cIn the third quarter of 2022, Nexters\u2019 revenue increased by $10 million (or 8% year-over-year) and amounted to $125 million, driven primarily by a decrease of $56 million in change of deferred revenues during the third quarter of 2022 vs. the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in bookings in the amount of $47 million (or 31%) year-over-year.*\n\n*Platform commissions increased by 10% in the third quarter of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021, generally in line with the increase in revenues.*\n\n*Game operation costs increased by $6 million in the third quarter of 2022 mainly due to the increase in the scale of operations, costs of the subsidiaries acquired in the beginning of 2022 vs nil in 2021 and special costs related to the relocation of personnel in the third quarter of 2022.*\n\n*Selling and marketing expenses in the third quarter of 2022 decreased by $43 million, or 68% year-over-year, and amounted to $20 million. The decrease was mainly due to the massive scaling of the investments into new players in the third quarter of 2021 amplified by a substantial decrease in the marketing investments in the third quarter of 2022 driven by the general saturation of the market as well as the suspension of marketing activities in Russia and Belarus due to recent geopolitical events.*\n\n*General and administrative expenses increased by $9 million in the third quarter 2022 vs. the third quarter 2021. The increase was primarily driven by i) the loss on disposal of discontinued operations in the amount of $5 million in the third quarter of 2022 vs. nil in the third quarter of 2021; ii) expected credit losses associated with loans provided to equity associates in the amount of $2 million in the third quarter of 2022 vs. nil in the third quarter of 2021; and iii) special costs related to the relocation of personnel in the third quarter of 2022.*\n\n*As a result of the factors above, amplified by the share listing expense in the amount of $125 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 vs. nil in the third quarter of 2022, net income in the third quarter of 2022 increased by $135 million and amounted to $31 million vs. a net loss of $104 million in the respective period of 2021, while Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $55 million, an increase of $41 million compared with the same period of 2021 due to the same factors, other than the impact of the share listing expense and the loss on disposal of the discontinued operations, which items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.*\n\n*Cash flows generated from operating activities amounted to $60 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $9 million vs. the third quarter of 2021.*\n\n*Third quarter operational performance in comparison*\n\n[bookings](https://preview.redd.it/zuaz363j8vpa1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed085e5dc8802564d138bcf8b064e2e6fdf1e37f)\n\n*Unlike the traditional console or PC gaming, where the peak of sales occurs after the launch of the game and then shrinks a lot, in the online mobile gaming market, the games are fluid and get updates each month/quarter if not on a weekly basis to engage customers and make them stay in the game longer. The Average bookings per paying user (ABBPU) is still high above 100$ mark and has seen a slight decline due to a reduction in spending on advertising (which benefitted the company by reducing their marketing costs & expenses)*\n\n*The share of advertisement sales as a percentage of total bookings decreased in the third quarter of 2022 to 4.6% compared to 5.9% in the respective period of 2021, a decrease of 1.3 p.p. mainly due to the general decline of the advertising market amplified by the fact that the advertisers\u2019 preferences shifted to non-gaming advertising venues in the third quarter of 2022 vs. the same period in the prior year.*\n\n*2021 was characterised by a relatively high investment in marketing, which led to high growth in MPUs. The decrease in the marketing investments for the majority of 2022 resulted in a corresponding decrease in MPUs in the third quarter of 2022, which reached 305 thousand in the third quarter of 2022 vs. 371 thousand in the respective period of 2021, a decline of 18%.*\n\n*The split of bookings by geography in the third quarter of 2022 remained broadly similar to the split in the third quarter of 2021 with a general increase in the share of US bookings.\u201d*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nNexters has weathered the storm and is looking forward to another profitable 4th quarter. The company is constantly involved with its fan base by engaging them on social media platforms like Twitter / Facebook and Discord. The return on NASDAQ will provide Nexters with the necessary capital to build out and achieve its growth plans. The company has a low float and the shares are majority held by insiders (>84%) providing a lot \u201cskin in the game\u201d.\n\nQ4 2022 will be out before may 2nd following the company switching external auditors from KPMG Russia to KPMG Europe.\n\n**3rd party app revenue verification**\n\nThe beauty of mobile games is that their data can be verified by 3rd party companies like AppMagic [https://appmagic.rocks/](https://appmagic.rocks/). This is the data for February from Sensor Towers\n\n**Nexters Global**\n\n[https://app.sensortower.com/ios/publisher/nexters-global-ltd/660706304](https://app.sensortower.com/ios/publisher/nexters-global-ltd/660706304)\n\n[app data](https://preview.redd.it/xwd65b7t8vpa1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2c90fa615c3e2045b9f1235929f98314cc09874)\n\n**Cubic Games** (owned by Nexters)- Pixel Gun 3D is their most popular game\n\n[https://app.sensortower.com/ios/publisher/publisher/561634640](https://app.sensortower.com/ios/publisher/publisher/561634640)\n\n**RJ Games** (Owned by Nexters) \u2013 Puzzle Breakers RPG Online\n\n[https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/publisher/RJ%2BGames](https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/publisher/RJ%2BGames)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider Ownership**\n\n[List of insiders](https://preview.redd.it/n3gn98sy8vpa1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a9f819092bc757f9c172c04fe6d8f1f47f55b03)\n\nInsiders and executives own close to 87% of the shares and warrants outstanding of Nexters providing a high \u201cskin in the game\u201d factor. The float of the company is therefore small, tightly held and trades in low volumes. The company has not issued additional shares since its inception and does not plan to do so in the near future as it\u2019s well capitalized. Given that the company has started trading again and is underfollowed, this provides in our view an opportunity for the share price to move quickly upwards as soon as the market rediscovers the company.\n\n**Warrants**\n\nThe warrants are quite compelling because they have a redemption feature that differs from the typical warrant redemption features used in many other blank check offerings, which typically only provide for a redemption of warrants for cash (other than the private placement warrants) when the trading price for the ordinary shares exceeds $18.00 per share for a specified period of time.\n\nThis redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding warrants to be redeemed when the ordinary shares are trading at or above $10.00 per public share, which may be at a time when the trading price of the ordinary shares is below the exercise price of the warrants. Nexters has established this redemption feature to provide it with the flexibility to redeem the warrants without the warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold (from the prospectus as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 18, 2022)\n\nFurthermore, per the prospectus the company has the right to lower the exercise price per share at any time prior to the warrant expiry date, which is also a positive for investors\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hiweuw659vpa1.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=599c8f421a2faf84beb08831ab457d5d51b97724\n\n**The addressable market**\n\nHow big is the addressable market? The World\u2019s 2.7 billion Gamers Spent $175 Billion on Games in 2020; The Market Will Surpass $200 Billion by 2023. So Nexters Global is well-positioned in the expanding market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[figures are from 2021 KISMET SPAC Deck](https://preview.redd.it/p3q9z9nb9vpa1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=272facfba6afd66c20ed5a5cdd6fb7e0da779d15)\n\nThis is a great company with solid financials and a bright future trading at ridiculously cheap bargain prices on low volume given the small float and high insider ownership. The company is critically underfollowed given its long hiatus from NASDAQ, so I would keep a close eye on the company given that the Q4 and FY 2022 results will be out around the end of April.\n\nThe valuation is quite low in our view, and provides big upside that could also lead to potentially being acquired by another big video game company like Tencent or Everix.\n\nLast but not the least, there\u2019s also chatter about announcing a \u201cHero Wars 2\u201d title on the 7th anniversary of the game.\n\nThanks for reading",

It represents a new way to convert** [**quantum information**](https://phys.org/tags/quantum+information/) **from the format used by quantum computers to the format needed for quantum communication.**\n\n**Photons\u2014particles of light\u2014are essential for** [**quantum information technologies**](https://phys.org/tags/quantum+information+technologies/)**, but different technologies use them at different frequencies. For example, some of the most common** [**quantum computing**](https://phys.org/tags/quantum+computing/) **technology is based on** [**superconducting qubits**](https://phys.org/tags/superconducting+qubits/)**, such as those used by tech giants Google and IBM; these qubits store quantum information in** [**photons**](https://phys.org/tags/photons/) **that move at microwave frequencies.**\n\n**But if you want to build a quantum network, or connect quantum computers, you can't send around microwave photons because their grip on their quantum information is too weak to survive the trip.**\n\n**\"A lot of the technologies that we use for classical communication\u2014cell phones, Wi-Fi, GPS and things like that\u2014all use microwave frequencies of light,\" said Aishwarya Kumar, a postdoc at the James Franck Institute at University of Chicago and lead author on the paper. \"But you can't do that for quantum communication because the quantum information you need is in a** [**single photon**](https://phys.org/tags/single+photon/)**. And at microwave frequencies, that information will get buried in thermal noise.\"**\n\n**The solution is to transfer the quantum information to a higher-frequency photon, called an optical photon, which is much more resilient against ambient noise. But the information can't be transferred directly from photon to photon; instead, we need intermediary matter. Some experiments design solid state devices for this purpose, but Kumar's experiment aimed for something more fundamental: atoms.**\n\n**The electrons in atoms are only ever allowed to have certain specific amounts of energy, called energy levels. If an electron is sitting at a lower energy level, it can be excited to a higher energy level by hitting it with a photon whose energy exactly matches the difference between the higher and lower level. Similarly, when an electron is forced to drop to a lower energy level, the atom then emits a photon with an energy that matches the energy difference between levels.**\n\n**Rubidium atoms happen to have two gaps in their levels that Kumar's technology exploits: one that exactly equals the energy of a microwave photon, and one that exactly equals the energy of an optical photon. By using lasers to shift the atom's electron energies up and down, the technology allows the atom to absorb a microwave photon with quantum information and then emit an optical photon with that quantum information. This translation between different modes of quantum information is called \"transduction.\"**\n\n**Effectively using atoms for this purpose is made possible by the significant progress scientists have made in manipulating such small objects. \"We as a community have built remarkable technology in the last 20 or 30 years that lets us control essentially everything about the atoms,\" Kumar said. \"So the experiment is very controlled and efficient.\"**\n\n**He says the other secret to their success is the field's progress in** [**cavity quantum electrodynamics**](https://phys.org/tags/cavity+quantum+electrodynamics/)**, where a photon is trapped in a superconducting, reflective chamber. Forcing the photon to bounce around in an enclosed space, the superconducting cavity strengthens the interaction between the photon and whatever matter is placed inside it.**\n\n**Their chamber doesn't look very enclosed\u2014in fact, it more closely resembles a block of Swiss cheese. But what look like holes are actually tunnels that intersect in a very specific geometry, so that photons or atoms can be trapped at an intersection. It's a clever design that also allows researchers access to the chamber so they can inject the atoms and the photons.**\n\n**The technology works both ways: it can transfer quantum information from** [**microwave photons**](https://phys.org/tags/microwave+photons/) **to optical photons, and vice versa. So it can be on either side of a long-distance connection between two superconducting qubit quantum computers, and serve as a fundamental building block to a quantum internet.**\n\n**But Kumar thinks there may be a lot more applications for this technology than just quantum networking. Its core ability is to strongly entangle atoms and photons\u2014an essential, and difficult task in many different quantum technologies across the field.**\n\n**\"One of the things that we're really excited about is the ability of this platform to generate really efficient entanglement,\" he said. \"Entanglement is central to almost everything quantum that we care about, from computing to simulations to metrology and atomic clocks. I'm excited to see what else we can do.\"**\n\n# Europe turbo charges its critical minerals drive\n\n[Column: Europe turbo charges its critical minerals drive | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/europe-turbo-charges-its-critical-minerals-drive-2023-03-24/)\n\n[ Geothermal water is seen through a sight glass at a pipeline system of a geothermal power station of German power supplier EnBW Energie Baden Wuerttemberg AG, where a pilot facility for lithium extraction will be built, in Bruchsal, Germany, April 23, 2021. REUTERS\\/Ralph Orlowski ](https://preview.redd.it/4ldv4swa1vpa1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a6d84aa5be9ba2f086ba53c363d8cbc0eb54672d)\n\nLONDON, March 24 (Reuters) - The European Union has unveiled the accelerator in its drive to reduce the bloc's import dependency for critical minerals and metals.\n\nThe Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) \"will significantly improve\" Europe's domestic extraction, processing and recycling capacity for metals such as lithium and rare earths, [**according to**](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1661) Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.\n\nThe Act comes with targets for production and for reducing dependency on any single third country. China currently dominates the supply chain for many of the entries on Europe's list of \"strategic\" metals.\n\nThe EU is also playing catch-up with the United States, which is already investing heavily in critical metals capacity under the aegis of [**the Defense Production Act**](https://www.lse.co.uk/news/us-uses-cold-war-powers-to-secure-battery-metals-supply-andy-home-ui49x2q5m2wz2t0.html) and [**the Inflation Reduction Act**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-hits-ev-accelerator-cut-chinese-metals-ties-2022-08-16/).\n\nEurope may, however, have given itself a competitive edge by moving to streamline project permitting, a tortuous process that often drags on for years before the first shovel hits the ground.\n\n## (MOVING) TARGETS\n\nThe CRMA covers a subset of the EU's [**critical minerals list**](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/critical-raw-materials_en), with particular focus on battery metals like lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese and magnet inputs such as boron and rare earths.\n\nCopper is on the list as an enabler of all things electric but aluminium and zinc aren't, which is a striking omission given the recent shrinkage of European production capacity.\n\nGermany's Speira has joined the list of casualties, this month announcing [**the full closure**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/germanys-speira-end-rheinwerk-aluminium-smelting-due-energy-costs-2023-03-09/) of its Rheinwerk aluminium smelter due to high energy costs.\n\n\"Today's strategic raw materials list must not be the finished picture,\" warned Evangelos Mytilineos, president of industry group Eurometaux.\n\nIt probably won't be. The CRMA includes a provision for periodically updating the list to reflect evolving economic importance and supply risks across the critical metals spectrum.\n\nFor those metals on the list the target is for the region to mine 10%, process 40% and recycle 15% of what it consumes annually by 2030. By which time not more than 65% of any strategic metal's consumption will be able to come from a single third country.\n\nThese are ambitious targets given Europe currently sources 97% of its magnesium in China, which also has a complete monopoly on the processing of heavy rare earths and graphite.\n\nEurope's lithium extraction can in theory meet the 10% target but it hinges on multiple new projects, many of them using innovative technology.\n\nRecycling lithium-ion batteries is also a technical challenge that has to be resolved at scale to meet the 15% recycling target.\n\n## PERMITTING\n\nIn terms of maximising domestic mining and processing capacity, Europe is following the United States in instructing all national governments to go back and look at what may have been left behind in tailings ponds and historic mine sites.\n\nOperators of existing mines and plants should prepare an economic assessment study of what they're losing in \"waste\" streams. It's a policy that has already significantly closed the U.S. dependency gap for tellurium and scandium.\n\nHowever, Europe has overtaken the United States in one key area, aiming to streamline the permitting of \"strategic\" projects to ensure a maximum time-line of two years for mines and one year for processing plants.\n\nAll such projects should be considered as being \"in the public interest\" by the relevant national authority when considering environmental impact.\n\nThe U.S. Administration has [**come under fire**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/bidens-ev-minerals-cash-fruitless-without-permitting-reform-2022-10-24/) for using the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivise domestic mining while simultaneously blocking development of mines on federal land. The green-on-green environmental clashes seem set to continue until there is a long-overdue rewrite of the General Mining Act of 1872.\n\n## COLLECTIVE BUYING AND STOCKPILES\n\nMany strategic metals markets are opaque, not easily financially hedged and concentrated on the supply side, according to the CRMA. All of which \"increases the negotiating power of sellers and increase prices for buyers\".\n\nIt calls for the Commission to set up a system for collective purchasing by interested buyers, a mechanism already trialled in the gas market.\n\nIt also recommends the accumulation of strategic metal stocks to buffer against unexpected supply disruptions. Europe has no strategic metal inventory, unlike the United States, China and South Korea.\n\nMember states may have their own stockpiles and \"as a first step and considering the lack of relevant information\", the 27 countries in the bloc should report to the Commission what, if anything, they are holding.\n\nGiven such a humble starting point, it seems unlikely EU strategic metal reserves are going to come any time soon, if they come at all.\n\n## METALLIC ARMS RACE\n\nThe EU accepts it will never be fully self-sufficient in most if any of the metals it's identified as being critical to its industrial and defence sectors.\n\nThe CRMA advocates diversifying supply in favour of \"reliable partners\" and creating \"mutually beneficial partnerships with emerging market and developing economies\".\n\nIt represents a further tectonic decoupling of global supply chains.\n\nWhat started as a response to China's dominance of critical metals supply has been accelerated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia has historically been a major supplier of aluminium, copper and nickel to Europe's industrial sector to the extent that the EU has to date held back from sanctioning Russian material even as the United States imposes penal import duties.\n\nBut the metals world is clearly starting to split between West and the East.\n\nIt's a messy process, witness the dispute between the EU and the United States over the exclusion of European products from the electric vehicle subsidies introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThat particular hurdle may shortly be cleared, German newspaper Handlesblatt [**reporting that**](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-lays-out-possible-critical-raw-materials-agreement-with-eu-handelsblatt-2023-03-23/) a draft agreement has been reached.\n\nIt is evidently in neither side's interest to compete with each other in the context of reducing resource ties with China and Russia.\n\nAssuming future trans-Atlantic harmony can be achieved, something akin to a metallic NATO will start to take ever clearer shape.\n\n \n\n# BIS Issues Proposed Rule to Establish \u201cGuardrails\u201d to Prevent the Improper Use of CHIPS Act Funding\n\nPosted on March 24, 2023POSTED IN [BIS](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/category/bis/), [SEMICONDUCTORS](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/category/semiconductors/), [SUPPLY CHAIN](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/category/supplychain/) \n\n [BIS Issues Proposed Rule to Establish \u201cGuardrails\u201d to Prevent the Improper Use of CHIPS Act Funding | SmarTrade (thompsonhinesmartrade.com)](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/2023/03/bis-issues-proposed-rule-to-establish-guardrails-to-prevent-the-improper-use-of-chips-act-funding/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afhv01j2gvpa1.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a9be7b6689dce1c573acced67e841e216b5513b9\n\nOn March 23, 2023, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published a [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-03-23/pdf/2023-05869.pdf) implementing measures to prevent the improper use of CHIPS Act Incentives Program funding. Described as \u201cguardrails,\u201d the proposed rules are intended to ensure technology and innovation funded by the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act are not used for malign purposes by adversarial countries against the United States or its allies and partners.\u00a0The CHIPS Act was enacted in August 2022 to incentivize the manufacture of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the United States, especially amid growing national security concerns and economic competition risks posed by China\u2019s increasing chip production in recent years. It provides appropriations to develop domestic manufacturing critical to U.S. competitiveness and national security interests. *See* Update of [July 29, 2022](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/2022/07/house-and-senate-pass-chips-and-science-act-of-2022-president-biden-expected-to-quickly-sign/).\n\nThe proposed rule provides additional details on national security measures that would be applicable to the CHIPS Incentives Program, including limiting recipients of funding from investing in the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in foreign countries of concern (i.e., China, Russia, Iran and North Korea). According to BIS, these guardrails \u201cwill advance shared national security interests as the U.S. continues coordinating and collaborating with allies and partners to make global supply chains more resilient and diversified.\u201d The proposed rule provides additional details on and definitions for these national security guardrails, including:\n\n* Establishing standards to restrict advanced facility expansion in foreign countries of concern.\n* Limiting the expansion of legacy facilities in foreign countries of concern.\n* Classifying semiconductors as critical to national security.\n* Reinforcing U.S. export controls.\n* Restricting joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern.\n\n## Establishing Restrictive Standards and Limiting Facility Expansion\n\nTo protect national security and the resiliency of supply chains, CHIPS Incentives Program funds may not be provided to a foreign entity of concern. The proposed rule provides a detailed explanation of what is meant by \u201cforeign entities of concern,\u201d as well as a definition of \u201cowned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of.\u201d The proposed rule defines other terms used in the CHIPS Act (including terms that will be used in required agreements with funding recipients), identifies the types of transactions that are prohibited under the Expansion Clawback and Technology Clawback sections of the CHIPS Act and provides a description of the process for notifying the Secretary of Commerce of significant transactions involving expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in a foreign country of concern.\n\n## Classifying Semiconductors as Critical to National Security\n\nWhile the CHIPS Act allows companies to expand production of legacy chips in foreign countries of concern in limited circumstances, the proposed rule would classify a list of semiconductors as critical to U.S. national security. In doing so, the rule would define \u201clegacy semiconductors\u201d subject to tighter restrictions, which would include \u201ccurrent-generation and mature-node chips used for quantum computing, in radiation-intensive environments, and for other specialized military capabilities.\u201d The proposed rule seeks to also clarify what would not be considered legacy semiconductors.\n\n## Reinforcing U.S. Export Controls\n\nIn October 2022, BIS implemented export controls to prevent China from purchasing and manufacturing advanced chips that would enhance that country\u2019s military capabilities. *See* Update of [October 31, 2022](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/2022/10/new-export-controls-target-support-for-chinas-advanced-computing-and-semiconductor-manufacturing/). The proposed rule provides definitions that are harmonious with and reinforce these export controls \u201cby aligning prohibited technology thresholds for memory chips between export controls and CHIPS national security guardrails.\u201d Accordingly, the proposed rule applies a more restrictive threshold for logic chips than is used for export controls.\n\n## Restricting Joint Research and Licensing\n\nThe proposed rule would prohibit during the term of a federal financial assistance award a recipient from knowingly engaging in any joint research or technology licensing with a foreign entity of concern that relates to a technology or product that raises national security concerns. In addition to any foreign entities of concern, the proposed rule would also add entities from BIS\u2019 Entity List, the Treasury Department\u2019s Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) list, and the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act list of equipment and services posing national security risks.\u00a0\n\n## Public Comment\n\nBIS will accept comments from all interested parties through May 22, 2023 via the federal eRulemaking portal or via email.\n\nThis BIS proposed rule seeks to align with similar national security \u201cguardrails\u201d included in the Department of the Treasury\u2019s\u00a0[Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1353), also issued on March 23, 2023, that details the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (Investment Tax Credit) administered by the Internal Revenue Service; *see* separate update [here](https://www.thompsonhinesmartrade.com/2023/03/treasury-issues-proposed-rule-to-clarify-the-advanced-manufacturing-investment-credit-established-by-the-chips-act/).\n\n# U.S. lays out possible critical raw materials agreement with EU -Handelsblatt\n\n[U.S. lays out possible critical raw materials agreement with EU -Handelsblatt (yahoo.com)](https://news.yahoo.com/u-lays-possible-critical-raw-184349101.html)\n\n[ FILE PHOTO: Picture shows European Union flags fluttering outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels ](https://preview.redd.it/y2ebtphw1vpa1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6be935051082daa824c493e145da0ee07529c8da)\n\n(Reuters) - The United States and the European Commission have negotiated a possible agreement to allow for electric vehicles with critical minerals extracted or processed in the European Union to qualify for U.S. green subsidies, Handelsblatt reported on Thursday.\n\nLithium, manganese, nickel and cobalt - key minerals for battery production - would fall under the agreement and should therefore qualify for subsidies under the U.S. $430-billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) package, according to the draft paper seen by German business paper Handelsblatt.\n\nUnder the IRA rules, electric vehicles can qualify for subsidies only if at least 40% of the critical minerals within come from the U.S. or a country it has a free trade agreement with.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed in early March that the two sides would launch talks on a raw material agreement that would allow vehicles with minerals sourced or processed in Europe to benefit.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Victoria Waldersee; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\n# Dig, Dig, Dig: US and Europe Target China\u2019s Grip on Critical Raw Minerals\n\nBy [Otto Lanzavecchia](https://cepa.org/author/otto-lanzavecchia/)**March 23, 2023**\n\n[ Europe and the US share a common goal \u2014 increasing self-sufficiency for minerals and tech products needed to fight climate change. Alignment looks set to defuse transatlantic trade tensions. ](https://preview.redd.it/jh4wav4qavpa1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=773c2ec0723a3c834e68424f3a7532ab3c720de9)\n\nThe European Commission unveiled this month a two-pronged strategy to reduce its dependency on China and boost its green industries. The [Critical Raw Materials Act](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_1661) aims to wean the continent off Chinese critical minerals. The [Net-Zero Industry Act](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_1665) is geared at boosting the EU\u2019s production of clean tech equipment by a [recent decision](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1563) to relax strict state aid rules.\n\nTogether, the proposals represent Europe\u2019s response to the US pressure against China and to compete with protectionist subsidies included in the US\u2019s [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/). Although a danger remains that the US\u2019s generous pockets and hard-line approach against China will sow discord, these European moves signal a desire to strengthen the transatlantic alliance.\n\nStart back in August 2022, when the US Congress passed the IRA, which contained gargantuan government subsidies to US industries. Europeans were [aghast](https://cepa.org/article/the-us-and-europe-should-fight-climate-change-together/). Confronted with sky-high energy prices and roaring inflation, they could hear a deafening sucking sound of investments leaving the continent and heading across the Atlantic Ocean. The US subsidies jolted European capitals to [reconsider](https://cepa.org/article/inflation-reduction-us-europe-clean-tech-subsidy-war/) their strict limits on state aid, instrumental in building and preserving the European single market.\n\nAt the same time, Vladimir Putin\u2019s weaponization of gas exports woke up the continent to the danger of Chinese-supplied critical raw materials and Beijing\u2019s dominance in green industries, such as solar panels and electric car batteries. If China cut sales of these key products, Europe\u2019s plans for its ecological and digital transition would be at risk of collapse \u2014 not unlike the United States\u2019.\n\nHow could Europeans condemn Americans for steeling themselves against the same threat they faced? The answer to that question challenged the EU\u2019s status quo, and European capitals began tilting westward. In January, while speaking in Davos, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen downplayed frictions over the IRA and stressed the need to \u201cde-risk\u201d vis a vis China.\n\nThe Biden administration took constructive steps: it began exploring extending some of the IRA\u2019s benefits to European industries. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai [had been urging](https://www.ft.com/content/0e52d609-5cfe-453c-9baf-b33b66e941e9) the EU to develop its own, parallel strategy on subsidies and reshoring, saying that the US wanted to \u201cwork with our friends and allies to allow us to together build a resiliency and to wean us off some dependencies.\u201d An agreement on critical raw materials would allow the US to extend the IRA\u2019s reach to European industries, indicated US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. EU countries began to adhere to the US-led [Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership-convening-supports-robust-supply-chains-for-clean-energy-technologies/), aiming to create a like-minded critical raw material \u201cbuyers\u2019 club\u201d between democratic countries.\n\nThe political breakthrough came on March 10. President von der Leyen went to the White House to meet President Biden, while back home her Commission relaxed state aid rules. Afterward, they produced [a statement](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_23_1613) signaling a transatlantic climate truce. And upon her return to Brussels, the Commission launched the two-pronged legislative proposals.\n\nThe Net Zero Industry Act aims to ensure that European produces at least 40% of European demand for green products by 2030. EU governments will be able to match subsidies provided in other countries \u201cwhere there is a real risk of investments being diverted away from Europe,\u201d [according to](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-state-aid-the-good-and-the-bad-of-opening-the-floodgates/) European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.\n\nThe Critical Raw Materials Act aims to supply Europe\u2019s green industries with crucial inputs. European mining and refining must cover at least 10% of the EU critical raw materials by 2030. That would be a giant feat for a continent that spent decades outsourcing most of the extraction and production.\n\nKey provisions have China written all over them. If a foreign country has more than 65% of the market, its companies will have little chance of winning a public contract in the EU. For context, Beijing controls more than 80% EU market share in the solar sector.\n\nPermitting will be sped up. It can [take up](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-green-dilemma-mining-key-minerals-without-destroying-nature/) to 15 years to get the green light for a new mining project in Europe. Under the Critical Raw Materials Act, mines designated as strategic must receive a decision on permits within two years.\n\nCritics question whether Europe can achieve its stated goals. Environmentalists [have vowed](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-green-dilemma-mining-key-minerals-without-destroying-nature/) to oppose projects to mine lithium and other minerals, citing the danger to water and nature preserves. Business leaders from Solvay, Merck, and Dow [warn](https://www.ft.com/content/6e6d71a1-a94b-45c9-ad5c-81f32e886301) that the Net Zero Industry Act offers too little funding and is too complex to compete against the US\u2019s $369 billion of\u00a0green tax incentives and subsidies.\n\nEven so, the European proposals signal a U-turn in economic policymaking \u2014 and a potential transatlantic alignment. On both sides of the Atlantic, the love affair with free markets and globalization is [fading](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-new-climate-plan-dont-burn-coal-burn-your-eu-ideals-european-commission-brussels-gunther-oettinger-beijing-us-pascal-lamy/). Instead of market-driven decision-making, we are entering an era of strategic planning with democracies moving to onshore and subsidizing critical industries.\n\nThe transition will be rocky and perilous. Divergences over how hard to hit China could re-emerge. The US takes a hard line, while European officials continue to consider Beijing both a \u201crival\u201d and a \u201cpartner.\u201d But both Brussels and Washington are working hard not to let their support for green tech deteriorate into a counter-productive and protectionist subsidy race. If they work together, they could shore up the democratic world\u2019s shift to clean tech.\n\n[*Otto Lanzavecchia*](https://formiche.net/author/ottolanzavecchia/) *is an Italian journalist for Formiche.net and Decode39.

What is your analysis? \n\nHere's the video in question: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DqMfvg\\_KzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DqMfvg_KzU)\n\nHe gets up to 1M views on his videos.\n\nAnd here's a comment that I pretty much agree with:\n\n>I kinda doubt your \"break Russia\" argument for raised interests rates. There's no real evidence for that besides speculation, as the only job of the central bank is to basically control inflation and unemployment. Secondly, while yes the US Fed might be doing that without openly saying it, I doubt all these other countries are on board. Imo you're SERIOUSLY underestimating the effects of inflation - it's tough here in Europe... Not everything needs to be seen through the lens of the Russia-Ukraine war. Yes, sure it might be a factor. But honestly it's economics is so complicated that no one event alone can take credit, especially not as prominently as you claim, when there's a very very real inflation problem. And if they are doing that for the sake of Russia, harming their own citizens, the inflation problem aside, there's no way to justify it. It's more of a lucky double whammy I suppose.  \n>  \n>EDIT: I'm gonna add something speculative as well... The Western world does NOT want Russia and it's economy to collapse. Not only will that harm innocent citizens, but there will be a sever shortage on other things that Russia produces besides oil: a food shortage worldwide, fertilizers etc. A collapsed Russia also means a power vacuum for a regime worse than Putin's, or a disintegration with nuclear weapons falling into wrong hands. During the Cold War tensions were way higher than they are now, yet behind all the talk of the enemy of the free world, no one legitimately wanted the USSR to collapse. A Russian collapse is a threat to the Western world, and it's leaders know it! They just can't say it publicly while they're trying to stop the war. And honestly the fix is pretty simple: get rid of Putin. It's literally that easy. No need to have another post-USSR anarchy moment. It's like trying to break America just because Trump was in power. Well guess what? He's gone now and the country is still intact and stable. Good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, feel free to analyse/break apart all of the above arguments. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your views!",

Als die ersten Berichte mutma\u00dflicher Kriegsverbrechen von ukrainischen Soldat:innen von Amnesty publik gemacht wurden, haben sich viele Organisationen offen gegen Amnesty gewandt, ihnen pro-russische Propaganda usw vorgeworfen. Dabei war Amnesty eine der ersten Institutionen, die humanit\u00e4re Hilfe geleistet, Netzwerke geschaffen und vor allem ma\u00dfgeblich an der Aufkl\u00e4rung der russischen Kriegsverbrechen beteiligt war.

    "content": "Dear President Putin,\n\nWe hold that your recent meeting with President Xi was a turning point in the history of your country as well as the world.  In retrospect, the invasion of Ukraine might be seen by future historians as a costly but necessary diversion to create your legacy: a Russia that pivots to the East rather than to the West.\n\nThe [Peace Plan for Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Peace_In_Ukraine/comments/11nnsj2/our_7point_peace_plan_for_the_war_in_ukraine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) will memorialize your pivot to the East. It provides a corridor to connect Russian-speaking communities in Ukraine, Moldova, and Crimea. It further details a mechanism to protect additional Russian-majority populations throughout Ukraine. \n\nNow it is time to completely pull out of Ukraine as specified in the Plan. Today. The people of these areas are too infected by the West, let them be. They may have to sink with the West as it drowns from its own decadence.\n\nThe real work begins immediately after. We have suggested that you rename your country \"Siber-Rus\" to implant in people's minds your vision. Instead of seeing the mission of outlying republics as supporting Moscow and St. Petersburg, declare that the pivot entails viewing the purpose of Moscow and St. Petersburg as one of supporting the outlying republics. Every one of them.\n\nThe world will soon rediscover there the essence of your vision. Proud, resilient, grounded people who are the firmament of the earth. A new civilization will gather in strength and purpose and engage in humanitarian competition with the West.\n\n\"To whom much is given, much will be required\" (Luke 12:48).\u00a0 Using  your leverage, following the precedent of the Decembrists, you must encourage the new oligarchs to move east as well and create oases of culture, education, and talent.\n\nSoon it is time for you and President Biden to resign and start your work at the Putin-Biden International Peace Center. We already have proposed a[location for the Institute](https://www.reddit.com/r/Peace_In_Ukraine/comments/10o6di9/the_birth_of_a_new_country_siberiarus/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n\nYour final task? Find your successor. You may have one in mind already but we suggest the following profile:\n\n1. A woman in the mold of a Catherine the Great,  Indira Ghandi, Margaret Thatcher, or Golda Meir. This person must be strong-willed and smart enough to yank the country in the new direction and resist any other centers of traditional power in the Old Russia.\n\n2.  Deep roots in one of the outlying Republics. She will not, of course, be the only leader in recent history to come from such regions.\n\nWe have but one request. Please bury Western fashion.  This has been done in much of MENA. Throw out every designer suit and tie. Haven't you just recreated the \"Golden Horde, the Kipchak Khanate, the Ulus Juchi, the western part of the Mongol empire which flourished from the mid-13th century to the end of the 14th century? You are a modern-day Genghis Khan, Juchi, and Batu. Dress like them.\n\nSigned on behalf of billions of people,\n\nu/Clear-Sight-Moon \nu/TrueReconciliation",

    "content": "So there have been more than a few questions regarding US and NATO\u2019s ammunition stockpiles due to reports of the difficulties in producing and sending enough artillery shells to Ukraine for their artillery duel against the Russians. This has also raised concern about PGM and missile stockpiles for a potential war across the Pacific.\n\nThis is only the latest news however, with a similar report of stockpile shortages back in 2011, as stated by this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html), during the NATO air intervention in Libya that depleted precision munitions for the European air units.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if this is in the same caliber (figuratively, not literally) as the above situations, but there were also reports of small arms ammunition shortages in the United States, such as this [2007 NBC News article](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20322566), during the height of their involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nI have seen two separate arguments for the causes of these situations:\n* One was that precision munition type weaponry are getting more expensive, more complicated to produce, and consequently more difficult to procure. Meaning that creating large stockpiles of these kinds of weapons are a significant budget commitment. (probably doesn\u2019t apply to dumb artillery shells nor small arms cartridges examples)\n* Second was that US and Europe have been in a \u201cpeacetime\u201d economy to the extent that it has hurt munitions manufacturing capacity, resulting in the long tool up time to get the production lines ready for Ukraine\u2019s demands.\n\nSo with that, I\u2019d like to ask about US munition production in the Cold War, particularly in artillery and early PGM munitions, because I want to better understand the state of affairs the US was in regarding ammunition production prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nLike, I know it was probably \u201cbetter\u201d, but by how much? A significant enough? Could it sustain an artillery conflict that the Russo-Ukraine War has shown could happen?\n\nThanks for reading.",
