    "content": "From article:\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) this week responded to a questionnaire to argue that protecting Ukraine against Russia‚Äôs yearlong invasion should not be one of America‚Äôs ‚Äúvital national interests,‚Äù knocking the Biden administration for indicating it‚Äôll support Kyiv as long as it takes.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúWhile the U.S. has many vital national interests ‚Äî securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party ‚Äî becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,‚Äù DeSantis said in response to a questionnaire on Ukraine sent out to possible 2024 presidential candidates by Fox News‚Äôs Tucker Carlson.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúThe Biden administration‚Äôs virtual ‚Äòblank check‚Äô funding of this conflict for ‚Äòas long as it takes,‚Äô without any defined objectives or accountability, distracts from our country‚Äôs most pressing challenges,‚Äù the Florida governor said.\r  \n\r  \nDeSantis, whom many consider likely to enter the 2024 race for the White House, hit the Biden administration for its moves in the conflict in a ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù appearance last month. His weighing-in on foreign policy may be another signal that he‚Äôs plotting a potential White House run. \r  \n\r  \nRussia invaded neighboring Ukraine more than a year ago, and the U.S. has given billions in aid to Ukraine as it fends off Moscow‚Äôs forces. Recently, the Biden administration pledged to send battle tanks to Kyiv, and now faces pressure to send over F-16 fighter jets. \r  \n\r  \nDeSantis said F-16s and long-range missiles should be ‚Äúoff the table‚Äù because the moves could risk ‚Äúdrawing the United States into the conflict and drawing us closer to a hot war between the world‚Äôs two largest nuclear powers.‚Äù \r  \n\r  \nThe U.S. ‚Äúcannot prioritize intervention in an escalating foreign war over the defense of our own homeland,‚Äù he said.\r  \n\r  \nDeSantis accused the Biden administration‚Äôs policies of pushing Russia into ‚Äúa de facto alliance‚Äù with China.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúBecause China has not and will not abide by the embargo, Russia has increased its foreign revenues while China benefits from cheaper fuel. Coupled with his intentional depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and support for the Left‚Äôs Green New Deal, Biden has further empowered Russia‚Äôs energy-dominated economy and Putin‚Äôs war machine at Americans‚Äô expense,‚Äù the governor said. \r  \n\r  \nFighting in Bakhmut ‚Äòvery tough,‚Äô Zelensky says\r  \nMoody‚Äôs weighs downgrade for six US banks following SVB collapse\r  \nThe Florida Republican also knocked a policy of ‚Äúregime change‚Äù in Russia, which he characterized as ‚Äúno doubt popular among the DC foreign policy interventionists‚Äù but which Biden has said is not the country‚Äôs position. \r  \n\r  \nAttempting to remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power ‚Äúwould greatly increase the stakes of the conflict, making the use of nuclear weapons more likely. Such a policy would neither stop the death and destruction of the war, nor produce a pro-American, Madisonian constitutionalist in the Kremlin. History indicates that Putin‚Äôs successor, in this hypothetical, would likely be even more ruthless.  The costs to achieve such a dubious outcome could become astronomical,‚Äù DeSantis wrote.",

And, of course, ol' soviet style bureaucracy which permeates everywhere and takes 9000% more time into account than it should for the smallest tasks. As I read from one of the DNR commanders: \"Ukrainian forces work like this: drone sees the target, the operator gives a signal to the artillery, fire. Our forces: drone (if we are lucky to convince higher-ups that they are not a \"fad\") sees the target, reports to the artillery, artillery writes a report to the commander, commander writes a report to his commander (repeat x times), this one checks it (or sends it higher if the target is especially important), orders fire, then the order goes all the way back, and till it arrives the target is gone. Why? Because everyone wants a medal or an acknowledgment, soviet style.",

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\"",

Hence the current idea of not supplying weapons to Ukraine. \n\nAlso Indian redditors provide a tiny fraction of Indian population. Modi must be doing something to win two elections back to back with absolute mandate. Before you hate on Modi, He is the most pro-US PM till date. The rest have been socialist and Or more pro Soviets. The Gandhi family are famously pro-Moscow. \n\nModi fans care about India. Our foriegn policy has been pretty much the same. Non-Alignment is an Idea of Nehru (the progenitor of the Gandhi family and the first PM, also a socialist. ). But it is still being carried on by the BJP government (The \"Hindu nationalist\") This should be enough to tell you that most Indians are united in the foreign policy. The idea that \"India has given enough in European wars\" Is VERY prevalent. It harkens back to the exploitation, murders, lootings and mass deaths on the hands of the British during the WW2. \n\nTill date, It has been only the teenagers who want to emigrate to Europe who have ever been in any support of Ukraine. A tiny fraction of RW ofc are Putin fanboys.

So nobody can ever just say sorry I don't understand you, you have to go through this crazy pantomime every time where everyone has to pretend they got what they want.\n\nWorst was a taxi, where they don't know where you want to go so they just drove around randomly untill you indicate you want to stop. You can complain or say it's not where you want to go, because then everyone loses face. So random taxi journeys abound.\n\nAs a tourist it was fun lol",

Thousands protested in Russia against the war, politicians & the media spoke out against it and all dissent was put down by the Government. Politicians assassinated, protesters imprisoned.  Hundreds of thousands of Russians left Russia because of the war, knowing there is nothing to stop Putin. (Imagine if YOU were in that position) Some of them are stuck there caring for elderly parents or family or who don't have the ability to escape. \n\n\nYou see this same hatred and Xenophobia on Reddit with people saying Russians are inherently evil and other vile crap. Exactly the same vile hatred that Nazis came out about minorities & the Jews to justify themselves. People saying that Russians are sub human or other horrific crap. It's disgusting and not true at all.

    "content": "> A desperate plea from the besieged Ukrainian Government to a New Zealand agri-business company for specialist help for the 2023 grain harvest was blocked by Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta, the Herald can reveal.\n> \n> New documents released to the Herald under the Official Information Act show how a direct request from the Ukrainian Minister of Agriculture and Food, Mykola Solskyi, for high-speed and mobile grain stackers was declined.\n> \n> Russia‚Äôs illegal invasion last February, which is ongoing - including bloody trench warfare across several fronts that has not been seen since World War II - has caused widespread destruction and death.\n> \n> By May 16 last year, when Solskyi approached Christchurch-based MHM Automation, which builds huge, high-tech grain stacking machines that help in the storage and handling of bulk grain and wheat, Russia‚Äôs aggression had knocked out 15 million tonnes of the country‚Äôs grain storage capacity.\n> \n> Farmers and officials in Ukraine, which has earned the moniker ‚Äúthe breadbasket of Europe‚Äù and is one of the world‚Äôs top grain producers, feared it would result in grain spoiling and potential famine in the vast traditional markets of Africa and Asia.\n> \n> The Ukraine Government was calling for help and in a second letter on June 1 made a specific aid request to MHM Automation for 10 grain stackers by May 2023 in advance of this year‚Äôs harvest.\n> \n> They hoped that the transportable 4WD, two-wheel-steer conveyor-belt machines, which are designed to unload wheat at a rate of 500 tonnes per hour, could quickly help save the country‚Äôs grain in bunkers.\n> \n> The long-established NZX-listed Christchurch-headquartered company, which exports the technology around the world but predominantly to Australia, quickly got an urgent proposal for aid funding together and sent it directly to the Foreign Minister Mahuta, as well as its local MP Megan Woods.\n> \n> Chief executive Richard Rookes proposed designing and building the grain stackers in its Christchurch workshop before shipping them to a transition facility in the Czech Republic.\n> \n> From there, the plan was to truck them overland to a ‚Äúnominated address‚Äù in Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine.\n> \n> The detailed submission put the final cost at $11.35 million.\n> \n> However, the deal never got off the ground.\n> \n> Mahuta‚Äôs response 13 days later, as released under the OIA but delayed due to an ‚Äúadministrative error‚Äù in processing the Herald‚Äôs request, is sympathetic to Ukraine‚Äôs plight and again condemns Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúunprovoked and unjustified attack‚Äù.\n> \n> ‚ÄúThe war is having a devastating impact, including on Ukraine‚Äôs economy and ability to trade,‚Äù Mahuta responded.\n> \n> ‚ÄúThe destruction of a significant part of Ukraine‚Äôs transportation infrastructure, as well as the destruction of grain silos and other disruption to agricultural production, is substantially impeding Ukraine‚Äôs ability to produce crops and deliver these to export markets.‚Äù\n> \n> The war‚Äôs impact, including the blockage of Ukraine‚Äôs access to the Black Sea, is also ‚Äúseriously jeopardising‚Äù food supply to ‚Äúsome of the most vulnerable parts of the world‚Äù, Mahuta acknowledges.\n> \n> But the minister declined the application, saying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) does not currently have a development co-operation programme for Ukraine and ‚Äúat this stage the Government‚Äôs focus is on humanitarian assistance to meet immediate needs, and responding to Ukraine‚Äôs requests for military equipment in defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù.\n> \n> She closed by saying: ‚ÄúI acknowledge that this news will come as a disappointment.

Mark Milley said Tuesday that Russia has \"lost.\" \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin \"thought he could defeat Ukraine quickly, fracture the NATO alliance, and act with impunity. He was wrong,\" Milley said while speaking to reporters in Brussels. \n\nThe top US general ripped into Moscow for launching an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, emphasizing that Russia has paid an \"enormous price on the battlefield\" as a consequence.  \n\n\"Russia is now a global pariah and the world remains inspired by Ukrainian bravery and resilience. In short, Russia has lost ‚Äî they've lost strategically, operationally, and tactically,\" Milley added. \n\nMilley's comments echoed an assessment from Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the United Kingdom's chief of defense staff, who in December said \"Russia is losing\" and the \"free world is winning.\"\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine last February, it was widely expected to conquer Kyiv in a matter of days. But Russian forces failed in that objective as Ukrainian troops put up a far stiffer resistance than expected. With the help of Western-supplied weapons, Ukraine has continued to defy expectations in this war. \n\nOver the course of 2022, the fighting largely shifted to Ukraine's east and the conflict morphed into a brutal, grinding war of attrition.\n\nPutin illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions in September, claiming them as part of Russia, despite the fact that Russian forces did not fully occupy these regions. A Ukrainian counteroffensive pushed Russian forces into retreat in parts of these territories ‚Äî including Kherson, the first major city Russia occupied after the invasion.\n\nThe war is raging on, and Russia, which mobilized hundreds of thousands of additional troops, has seemingly begun a new offensive in the east with the goal of swallowing the Donbas region ‚Äî comprised of Donetsk and Luhansk, two of the regions Putin illegally annexed. Russian gains have been limited though.\n\nBoth sides have experienced heavy losses since the invasion began. Russian casualties estimated to be nearing 200,000.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has warned that Putin is unfazed by the high rate of casualties and is vying to overwhelm Ukrainian forces with sheer numbers. \n\nPutin is \"sending thousands and thousands of more troops, accepting a very high rate of casualty, taking big losses, but putting pressure on the Ukrainians,\" the NATO chief said on Monday, adding, \"What Russia lacks in quality, they try to compensate in quantity.\"",

They killed 11 including seven civilians and destroyed buildings in the old city of Nablus, which is a UNESCO heritage site.\n\nThe US is a joke. The EU is even a bigger joke.

Even after Feb 22 he was still open to peaceful means of ending it like proposing referendums for the Donbas and a 15 year pause on Crimea with Russia still occupying it.\n\nBut the Russians rejected all of it, instead pushed for maximalist demands, Ukraine change in govt, demilitarising whole arm, giving up all occupied land etc. At the beginning they were even essentially asking to choose the head of govt for Ukraine. Then they reinforced the above by committing war crimes right and left. \n\nAnd at some point a pacifist that is smart will realise the futility of a situation and the existential threat they are in. Continually proposing peace for an unhinged enemy that wants you dead is pretty much just laying down with your throat open. And it won't be just you but your people too. This is what Zelensky realised and he's been consistent since. They can't trust them especially with Putin there. And they also can't give up land to them because they will be back for the rest.",

The reality is that for infantry who are fighting for territory, it doesn't matter if the big mobile cannon firing at you is a western tank or a t-90  or even a t-55. It's still gonna ruin your day. An infantryman doesn't want to know what kind of tank he's fighting. He doesn't care. It's a tank. \n\nBut for tank crews, yeah it matters. But to think that western tanks will completely change the war is a very one dimensional view. However they will help to shift the balance in that mid-level crunch between artillery, then crossing the ground. But it's still the infantry that have to hold it. That's why it's great we have these amazing tanks but the IFVs that move in and around are just as important. As is the quality of body armour and PPE for the troops. ALL of this has to go in together or none of it works. So when people were mocking Germany for supplying helmets... actually maybe think again.\n\nAnd now Ukraine has access to one of the best MBTs in the world. Again thanks to Germany.\n\n(I'm British)",

He really proved to be a great leader for his country and people in very awful, desperate times. I don't think that Ukraine would stand where it does right now without him. Sure, he's far from the only one responsible for Ukraines success, but he played a pivotal role in gathering international support and strengthening the moral of his people. How he handled that will be discussed in future history classes.",

It takes two for a war, if the defender gives up it's just a good ole fashioned massacre. Putin has made it clear his desire to reestablish the iron curtain and the USSR and he won't stop at Ukraine.

Do we do that or do we allow him to conquer eastern Europe before attacking NATO countries? What message does it send China who is eyeing Taiwan.\n\nThese are very dangerous times, but this is what happens when the US turns inward and spurns the role it created for itself at Bretton Wood.

On the one hand you have the west/Europe for which Russia's predecessor, the Soviet Union, was  \"the enemy\" or the oppressor for 45 years. In the west Russians were continually portrayed as the bad guys in movies and media. As such there is latent hostility that the war in Ukraine merely caused to resurface. Much of the rest of the world has no particular historical animosity towards Russia and may in fact have positive views. I think this is part of the disconnect. It would also explain why the west has reacted with white hot anger towards Russia in a way that other recent conflicts have failed to do. Thus I highly doubt that the west is going to get non-western nations to be as passionate as themselves. \n\nThis is not a commentary on the war itself as the only solution is for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. In addition I think the west portraying this as a struggle for good versus evil might ring hollow for countries that have had negative dealings with the west. I think it would go over better if it were portrayed more practically as a means to prevent one country from invading another as a general principle, but then this might draw comparisons with Iraq.",

    "content": "Here\n\nJOHANNESBURG ‚Äî Clement Manyathela, who hosts a popular and influential talk show on South Africa‚Äôs Radio 702, remembers the outrage he felt when Russian troops first surged into Ukraine. He had believed Russia‚Äôs insistence that it wasn‚Äôt planning to attack and felt cheated when war broke out.\n\n‚ÄúWe were lied to,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut as the fighting continued, he, and many of those who call in to his show, began to ask questions: Why had President Vladimir Putin deemed it necessary to invade? Was NATO fueling the fire by sending so many weapons to Ukraine? How could the United States expect others around the world to support its policies when it had also invaded countries?\n\n‚ÄúWhen America went into Iraq, when America went into Libya, they had their own justifications that we didn‚Äôt believe, and now they‚Äôre trying to turn the world against Russia. This is unacceptable, too,‚Äù Manyathela said. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt see any justification for invading a country, but we cannot be dictated to about the Russian moves on Ukraine. I honestly feel the U.S. was trying to bully us.‚Äù\n\nIn the year since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, a reinvigorated Western alliance has rallied against Russia, forging what President Biden has trumpeted as a ‚Äúglobal coalition.‚Äù Yet a closer look beyond the West suggests the world is far from united on the issues raised by the Ukraine war.\n\nThe conflict has exposed a deep global divide, and the limits of U.S. influence over a rapidly shifting world order. Evidence abounds that the effort to isolate Putin has failed, and not just among Russian allies that could be expected to back Moscow, such as China and Iran.\n\nIndia announced last week that its trade with Russia has grown by 400 percent since the invasion. In just the past six weeks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been welcomed in nine countries in Africa and the Middle East ‚Äî including South Africa, whose foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, hailed their meeting as ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù and called South Africa and Russia ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù\n\nOn Friday, a year after the invasion began, the South African navy will be engaged in military exercises with Russia and China in the Indian Ocean, sending a powerful signal of solidarity at a moment the United States had hoped would provide an opportunity for reinvigorated worldwide condemnations of Russia.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves around the world as millions of refugees fled the country, grain shipments were delayed and Russian gas curtailed. (Video: Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nConversations with people in South Africa, Kenya and India suggest a deeply ambivalent view of the conflict, informed less by the question of whether Russia was wrong to invade than by current and historical grievances against the West ‚Äî over colonialism, perceptions of arrogance, and the West‚Äôs failure to devote as many resources to solving conflicts and human rights abuses in other parts of the world, such as the Palestinian territories, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe Western countries ‚Äúare hypocritical,‚Äù said Bhaskar Dutta, a clerk in Kolkata, India. ‚ÄúThese people colonized the entire world. What Russia has done cannot be condoned, but at the same time, you cannot blame them wholly.‚Äù\n\nU.S. officials point out that 141 of 193 countries voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia after the invasion; the same number approved a nearly identical resolution on the eve of the anniversary Thursday. But only 33 countries have imposed sanctions on Russia, and a similar number are sending lethal aid to Ukraine. An Economist Intelligence Unit survey last year estimated that two-thirds of the world‚Äôs population lives in countries that have refrained from condemning Russia.\n\nThis is not a battle between freedom and dictatorship, as Biden often suggests, said William Gumede, who founded and heads the Johannesburg-based Democracy Works Foundation, which promotes democracy in Africa. He pointed to the refusal of South Africa, India and Brazil to join Biden‚Äôs global coalition.\n\nThat reluctance, he said, is the outgrowth of more than a decade of building resentment against the United States and its allies, which have increasingly lost interest in addressing the problems of the Global South, he said. The coronavirus pandemic, when Western countries locked down and locked out other countries, and President Donald Trump‚Äôs explicit disdain for Africa, further fueled the resentment.\n\nAs the West pulled back, both Russia and China stepped into the vacuum, aggressively courting developing nations and capitalizing on the disillusionment with the United States and Europe by presenting an alternative to perceived Western hegemony. The Middle East and Africa are key battlegrounds in this struggle for hearts and minds, as are Asia and, to a lesser extent, Latin America, whose fortunes are more closely bound by geography to the United States.\n\nThe Middle East is one region where Russia has succeeded in winning friends and influence, said Faysal, a retired Egyptian consultant on organized crime who asked that his full name not be used because of the sensitivity of discussing political issues in Egypt.\n\n‚ÄúOf course I support Putin,‚Äù he said in an interview in Cairo. ‚ÄúA long time ago, we lost faith in the West. All the Arabs on this side of the world support Putin, and we are happy to hear he is gaining lands in Ukraine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a failure of the West in the past 15 years to see the anger building up around the world, and Russia has absolutely exploited this,‚Äù Gumede said. ‚ÄúRussia has been able to portray Ukraine as a war with NATO. It‚Äôs the West versus the rest.‚Äù\n\nDespite Western efforts to attribute global inflation and a food crisis to the Russian invasion, most countries around the world blame the West for the imposition of sanctions, said Kanwal Sibal, a former Indian foreign secretary.\n\nThey do not subscribe to the narrative that countering Russia is a moral imperative if the principles of democracy and territorial integrity and the rules-based world order are to be upheld, Sibal said.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an argument that serious people buy,‚Äù he said, citing the NATO bombing of Serbia, U.S. support for dictatorships during the Cold War, and the Iraq War as examples of what he sees as the United States violating those same principles.\n\n‚ÄúThe rest of the world genuinely sees this as a European war. They do not see a global conflict or the way it is presented by the West,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYes, it has international repercussions such as inflation. But those repercussions are because of the sanctions.‚Äù\n\nIn refusing to risk its relationship with Russia, India is taking a hardheaded view of its own interests, he said, including its dependence on Russia for military supplies and the opportunity to hold inflation at bay by buying discounted Russian oil. There are tens of thousands of Chinese troops massed on India‚Äôs border with China, its geopolitical rival, and India can‚Äôt afford to alienate Russia or risk any interruption of its weapons supplies, he said.\n\nThe United States needs India to counterbalance China and, after initial attempts to pressure New Delhi to fall into line with its policies, now appears to have accepted India‚Äôs position, Sibal said. The United States decided not to impose sanctions on India for a missile deal it concluded with Russia last year and instead has been pursuing expanded ties, including its own defense deals.",

    "content": ">I was always interested in how the West percieved many countries not sanctioning Russia as a betrayal, As a serious non-rhetorical question Did you westerners see the Global South as your ally?\n\nI would gladly give you my opinion on this as I think it's a very interesting question. Keep in mind this is just my perspective on the matter and as I have very rarely seen my thoughts on this talked about anywhere else, maybe I'm a bit out there haha\n\n\nYou see, morals in the west are very heavily influenced by what we call human rights. For a long time (hundreds of years) the dominating moral force in the west was Christendom, and then during the 20th century there was a period of chaos were Christendom was replaced by different political ideologies (communism, national-socialism, fascism, etc) and in the end the last political ideology standing was \"human rights/democracy\". What I want to say is that this human rights stuff is a very important pillar on how people in the west understand the world, how they think society should look like, what rules they think society should follow, and so on. It's kind of a mix between a political ideology, a religion, and something like confucianism. A set of overarching values. Every society has to believe in something, right. \n\nNow, every culture has a different moral dogmatic pillar as a foundation. The wests is human rights, in the Islamic world it's the rules of Islam, and I'm too uneducated to say what this foundation is exactly for other parts of the world. Some of these are missionaric and claim to be universal, thereby inducing the need to  convert everyone else ; while some are not. Like I said the old foundation of the west culture was the extremely missionaric christendom, and it morphed into the human rights, but one aspect it kept is it being missionaric. \n\nPeople in the west genuinely believe that human rights (whatever \"human rights\" entails, as that changes all the time ofc, like the details of the beliefs of other cultures change too) must be spread everywhere in the world. They also don't see human rights as a western thing, but there is the believe that human rights are so fundamental and universal that every human has to believe in them by default. Now the situation in Ukraine is clearly a violation of human rights by Russia. This is \"Haram\" for the western beliefs. This results in this situation/ belief (it really has a lot of similarities to religion) where the belief is that one  must support Ukraine/be anti Russia, or otherwise one is \"Haram\". That explains why westeners see the behavior of the global south in regards to the Ukraine war as a betrayal. A betrayal against human rights, a betrayal against their core beliefs. It's less that they see the global south as nation-states as allies, but they see every single individual human as an ally. \n\n\nLike I said, don't take my ramblings as the truth or anything, it's just my personal view on this stuff. But I hope it's an interesting read for you. And as it seems the other replies to your comment agree with me, they just don't need three paragraphs to explain it: we the people in the west truly believe in the ideals of human rights.\n\nEdit: I would also like to mention that \"betrayal\" is a very strong word and in reality, most people do not feel as much much negativity towards the inaction of the global south as that word implies. Disappointment? Sure. But not betrayal as in \"my wife betrayed me with another man\" or \"we have an alliance with countries in the global south an they betrayed us\".",

Navies take decades to build up, and China only recently began serious efforts towards this.\n\nChina scaled back their aircraft carrier program after building a pretty decent looking modern carrier.

Said country has received the most modern equipment that many of the suppliers have, even though this would normally be an absolute no go and now the fact that one item on the wish list is not available immediately because of very real concerns (and the fact that Germany would have to take up to a year to refurbish the requested tanks) means that we are responsible for killing Ukrainians.\n\nI was already tired of the childlike indignation of Ukrainians before this fake discussion came along, but by now I am really wondering if this is even worth it. The East of Ukraine has always been staunchly Russian and has done its best to sabotage a united Ukraine, the country itself is a corrupt mess and there is absolutely nothing for us to be gained from helping them, especially since we are already financing and supporting a whole lot of other corrupt and ungrateful former Soviet States that love to waste our money.",

Columbine (or Sandy Hook, I forget which) was rebuilt with concrete seats in hallways to break line of sight and provide cover for students hiding from an active shooter. It could be that the envisioned new Mariupol is simply a pleasant place to live as a charm offensive, but for example if it's designed so lots of reinforced concrete buildings with underground basements w easily convertible into bunkers are on its west side while the east facilitates easy transport to/from Russia, I think some conclusions would be easy to draw.",

I didn't support the war but I was buying in the \"Russians needing to protect their west flank from American/Nato tampering\", at least partially.\n\nI kind of thought that Zelensky's hard stance against Russia rather than playing fool to catch wise could've added to the tension.\n\nBut with time I came to the conclusion that I was wrong. Plain and simple. I was naive.\n\nThis whole military action and Russian agenda has absolutely nothing to do with Russian's security (which is forever secured by a minimal investment in nuclear weapons to be honest, nothing can save anyone from them), Nato, and not even imperialistic ambitions by Putin. Even those are honestly idiotic. If Putin really has had such imperialistic ambitions he would've acted on them earlier.\n\nReality is that this is all about Putin's autocracy. Putin knows that Russians consider themselves and Ukrainians the same people, so even if he could and can sleep just fine with Finland or Sweden joining NATO, as this poses no threat to his regime nor Russia, he cannot sleep well knowing that his citizens can look at Ukraine and see that a really democratic government, one that fights corruption and works for its citizens is possible. Because the instant message for Russians is that an alternative to Putin's autocracy is possible and he's scared shitless of that.\n\nHe was burning classified documents in Berlin in the very same moment that people were bringing down the Berlin wall, he was a KGB officer there. He knows that change to autocratic regimes can come at any time and that this leaves people like him ousted, at the very least. He's scared shitless of \"real\" democracy.\n\nIt's incredible world is heading into global recessions, thousands are dying, tensions are rising, I'm paying more than 4 times the energy bills I paid just 18 months ago, all because this shithead wants to transform Russia in a tsardom again.\n\nIt's terrible, awful.\n\nWe all need to do our best and push our legislators to help Ukraine as much as possible.\n\nArm them, train them, send all the money we can, sanction any country doing business with them, whatever we can so we can make Russian population suffer as much as possible, at the end of the day, Russians aren't stupid, they overthrew not one but two regimes that looked impossible to overthrow (the Tsar first and the Soviet Union second), they can understand the world around them and they're aware that most of what they hear in their tv is straight propaganda.\n\nI am honestly sorry for not emphasizing enough with Ukraine. I did donate 200 euros to Ukraine in recent days and I plan to donate 2% of my monthly income for the foreseeable future at each check I receive.\n\nIf Putin wins, it's not just Russia winning and Ukraine losing, Europe isn't threatened by Putin's army, they can barely fight against Ukraine, but if Putin wins this is a very huge setback for democracy globally, for our own life styles and dignity.",

Since it gained independence in 1776, the United States has constantly sought expansion by force: it slaughtered Indians, invaded Canada, waged a war against Mexico, instigated the American-Spanish War, and annexed Hawaii. After World War II, the wars either provoked or launched by the United States included the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the War in Afghanistan, the Iraq War, the Libyan War and the Syrian War, abusing its military hegemony to pave the way for expansionist objectives. In recent years, the U.S. average annual military budget has exceeded $700 billion, accounting for 40 percent of the world's total, more than the 15 countries behind it combined. The United States has about 800 overseas military bases, with 173,000 troops deployed in 159 countries.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to the book America Invades: How We've Invaded or been Militarily Involved with almost Every Country on Earth, the United States has fought or been militarily involved with almost all the 190-odd countries recognized by the United Nations with only three exceptions. The three countries were \"spared\" because the United States did not find them on the map.\"\n\nLOL",

There is currently a power struggle between Wagner and the official Russian military brass, and so they're deliberately having Wagner try to force through despite the losses, as they don't really care about them dying. The fighting will weaken both the Ukrainian and Wagner forces. Best outcome for the Russian command here is a very bloody victory so that they can both claim Bakhmut and cripple Wagner in their power struggle.",

    "content": "Casualties are quite high, Zelensky's comments on the difficulty of the fight only speaks to the troubles there. But I do think the issue here is that information garnered is received in snippets, often very difficult to get the full picture. As an example, one of Wagner's biggest issues and complaints now is that Ukraine is managing to rotate out troops, as in not throw everyone in for defense. This means fresh troops to the front compared to russia's often replacements only occurring due to loss of life.\n\nAnother important factor is that spring is here which complicates matters a lot more. All those images and clips of field littered with dead russians, often that was on frozen ground. What is happening now is that russians are not able to properly use their mechanized weaponry (often if one is blown up, they panic) so their troops are forced to be on foot. Well, when you are trying to move forward in mud, you are going to die a really unpleasant death.\n\nThird is essentially the movement of troops for Ukraine. At the moment, Ukraine has been participating in counter attacks but not yet been on the offensive. It appears movements have been occurring across good portion of the line (not just Bakhmut). Not saying with few days or week, but Ukraine will be going on the offensive. And this can be promised, russia has lost a lot of their fight trying to take Bakhmut and reinforcing their offense there. Hell, majority of Wagners \"troops\" (massive portion being convicts\" are now dead which is why there is a sudden push for recruitment. I know there was the idea of Wagner being tossed at Ukraine because they were an \"issue\" for putin and much easier to deal with and fewer complaints when dead.\n\nAll-in-all my mindset is of this. Casualties are high, the fight is brutal, there is the real possibility of things going very badly. But, that is not a guarantee and soon more answers will present themselves. During war one of the scariest moments is when there is silence. So when I notice a whole lot of silence coming from Ukraine's side in mid and lower eastern side, that says a lot. Could be mistaken and just a guess but that is my hunch at least.",

How would you reasonably negotiate with that?\n\nUkraine just wants peace.... and possession of their lands.  If they give up land to Russia now, they are setting themselves and other countries up for more lands grabs (and more wars) in the near future.  Anything that \"rewards\" Russia for these crimes will empower them and cause them to do more evil.\n\nSaying you want the war to end is not the same as stating that the two countries should negotiate peace.  How?  Russia will not allow for peace.  They want conflict and destruction.\n\nThe longer the world turns their back and waits for this war to end, the more empowered Russia becomes.

In other words, they will not open any chapters. There are very serious problems with our EU membership at the moment, but these problems are not the kind problems that cannot be solved. These problems will come to an end when we bring democracy to the full with our own free will.\"\n\n***\"POLITICAL ETHICS LAW WILL BE IMPLEMENTED\"***\n\nKƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said that their main goal is to \"establish very good and close relations with countries with developed democracies\".\n\nWhen asked about the economic reforms they will implement to increase their living standards if they come to power, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said, \"A political ethics law will be enacted. The political institution will be purified from pollution. It will be fought against extravagance. For example, Erdogan has 16 planes, we will sell 15 of them, we will save income for the treasury. Like the President of the Central Bank, the Chairman of the Capital Markets Board, the President of the Public Procurement Authority, the competent people, that is, the people who are qualified in the government, who know the job and thus arouse respect in the public, will be appointed, not political people.\"\n\n***FOREIGN POLICY WITH RUSSIA***\n\nAsked by a student, \"What will be the prediction of Turkey's foreign policy towards Russia,\" Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu stated that Turkey has economic relations with Russia and said, \"While Western countries did not provide many technologies in the past, Russia did. For example, aluminum, glass industry, petrochemical industry. Russia has provided for Turkey in these areas. But Turkey has developed the technology, and perfected it. We will continue our economic relations.\"\n\nKƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said, \"We think that we should stand by Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war. It is not right for a country with nuclear weapons to invade the territory of a country that does not have nuclear weapons and to start a war.\"\n\nCHP Chairman Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said, \"Turkey's dependence on Russia in terms of energy and the increase in this rate will increase this dependency, especially with the activation of the nuclear power plant, and we express in different environments that this will pose a serious problem for Turkey.\"\n\n***\"WE NEVER CONSIDER BEING PARTIES IN THE ARAB WORLD'S OWN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS\"***\n\n\"How do you see Turkey's relations with the Gulf countries? In particular, how do you plan to restore trust between Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)?\" Responding to the question, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said that foreign policy should not be a reason for a fight between the parties, should be national, and should be built on the interests of the country.\n\nKƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said, \"We want to be in harmony with all our neighbors, whether with Gulf countries, Syria or Iran. We also want to develop economic relations. Therefore, we do not find it right to be a party in the internal affairs of the Arab world. On the contrary, if there is a conflict between them, it is important to end the conflict.\" If we have a task, we find it right to fulfill it.\"\n\nTouching on the murder of Washington Post columnist Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu stated that they think differently from the government on this issue and said, \"The file of a murder committed in Turkey cannot be handed over to Saudi Arabia. It is an illegal practice and this practice has already been implemented. severely criticised.\"\n\nKƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu, to the question regarding the Istanbul contract, \"We have a commitment. When we come to power, we will put it into effect within a week.\"",

Good God!\n\nRussia‚Äôs current militarily-unprovoked brutal attack against and mass slaughter of Ukrainian people may be a reflection of the perceived human disposability in Stalin‚Äôs Soviet Union.

So we have to drain our economy to extreme levels (we give the largest percentage of our GDP to the military inside NATO, more than the US and nearly double the NATO guideline) to make an army that can withstand an enemy 9 times our size and to condemn every male Greek citizen to one year of conscription.

We do it because we have to and you are part of the reason for that.\n\nA few more points:\n\n- Everyone until 2021 said that Putin would not invade Ukraine, yet here we are in the second year of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Verbal reassurances mean nothing.\n- Turkey has already invaded and occupied a huge chunk of Cyprus, proving full well that it is both capable and willing to invade its neighbours.\n- There is at least one incident a week with Turkish ships or planes illegally entering our national waters and air space respectively only to be escorted out by our forces, plus the constant threat on our fishermen.\n- There is an active casus belli (by definition a threat of war) against Greece exercising its international right to expand its territorial waters, something that conveniently Turkey has already done in the Black Sea.\n\nFor all that and much more, if you can help it, try to vote as an informed human for once and not as a towel in the wind.

You're making that claim now, but we as a country are rightfully unwilling to put our sovereignty at risk in order to test this, especially when Turkey itself has invaded and occupied a neighbor already (Cyprus 1974; something that you'd need to fix before playing the \"We are not Russia\" card). It does make sense to compare them though, because they use the exact same rhetoric to a scary degree. The thing that cannot be compared is the dynamic of the two countries. When Russia invaded Ukraine, it (wrongly) assumed that the invasion would be a walk in the part. With Turkey, the invasion would almost certainly fail, not only because of the power difference, but also because of the terrain and Greece's alliances. But, as I explained a few times already, to keep that balance that is the only thing differenciating our situation, we bleed our economy to extreme degrees.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't matter what your circle may think. The fact is that it is the only thing all your politicians agree about, so there must be some public will or tolerance and that alone is enough to make you dangerous. We've seen worse offences with smaller support. There's nothing to overstate about it and nothing to use in political propaganda from our side. In fact, it's quite hard to use a casus belli that's strong enough to prevent us from exercising our international rights and weekly border violations in propaganda.

Instead, there is a very clear precedent of NATO saying \"Figure it out\" every time Turkey makes a threat (their hatred for Erdoƒüan changed that recently, but it could go back if they elected someone who's less visibly crazy). There is also a very clear precedent of Turkey being favored because of the Istanbul strait. If anything, the EU seems a much better source of safety, mainly because of the fact that we are a member and Turkey isn't. Or of course France specifically, because we have a very recent bilateral defense agreement with France and they have always been a strong and trustworthy ally in the past.",

The islands belong to Greece according to the Lausanne agreement (the last one about the Greek-Turkish borders), except the Dodecanese Islands that were given to Italy by other agreements at the same era (S√®vres perhaps?) and then given to Greece by Italy after WW2. Now, Turkey decided to unilaterally reconsider the agreement and decide that the islands are theirs. The thing is that Turkey (Kemal, not the Sultan) not only signed that agreement, but they negotiated from a position of power as well, having beaten Greece quite comprehensively in 1922, so I can see no justification for any doubt. I haven't heard the moral justification of Turkish politicians on the matter, but a practical justification that makes sense is that it limits their access to the Aegean and thus the Mediterranean, due to the distribution of the islands. But then again, Turkey itself has the straits of Istanbul and there are peaceful agreements that define who can pass and who can't, so it's not something unsolvable. Then, Turkey complains that we have a strong navy in the area, but you'd have one too if a neighbour was constantly threatening your sovereignty and violating your airspace and (limited) territorial waters. Ukraine had most of its army in position as well and they haven't regretted it one bit. Basically the vast majority of our military (including the mandatory conscription of 1 year for every male Greek citizen) exists for that reason.\n\nThen, there is the territorial water issue. According to international law, countries have a right to 12 nautical miles off their coast. This was expanded from 6 nautical miles I don't even know when. Now, Greece hasn't been able to expand its territorial waters, because Turkey has placed a casus belli on Greece for that matter. Now, Turkey claims that the law doesn't apply, because they haven't signed the international agreement that allows it, but on the other hand they themselves have expanded their territorial waters to 12 nautical miles in the Black Sea, so it applies sometimes.\n\nWith Cyprus, the subject is quite a bit more complicated, with all sides carrying at least some fault, including the then president of Cyprus and of course the Brits who created the whole mess to begin with.",

It took decades of blatant disrespect to international law by Turkey *and* a bunch of personal interests to achieve that change.\n\n> Putin and Erdoƒüan are not the same. Putin already invaded other places, Turkey has no such power. Please find me 1 academic source who claims Turkey's operation in northern Iraq and Syria is similar with Russian invasions in Georgia or Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin and Erdoƒüan are not the same. Erdoƒüan does not invade. I mean, he *does* invade, but I arbitrarily decided that it's different. But then again I decided to ignore the illegal occupation of Cyprus that I can't even pretend is different\". I'm pretty sure you'd hear the exact same argument the other way round if you asked a Russian who knows about the Greek-Turkish relationship.\n\nPutin and Erdoƒüan are much more similar than you'd like to believe, from the way they have imposed themselves over their countries to the way they bully anyone and everyone to get what they want. In any case, the fact that you immediately jumped into supporting Putin when he came up shows that you are not as sophisticated as you'd like to believe (although this was kinda obvious from the way you're devouring propaganda).",

Since you are very dramatic about this stuff, I guess you are aware that some of those islands are far more closer to Turkey than 12 miles.\n\nAre you for real??? The international rights of a country, including Greece, say that the territorial waters can expand up to 12 miles from the coast **or the half point between the two coasts.** Nobody disagreed with that part. Nobody wants to come inside *your* legally recognised territorial waters, but we want *our* territorial waters. Like for example the waters of the Cyclades, that are hundreds of miles away from Turkey and are still covered by the casus belli. Or the waters south of Crete, which have nothing to do with Turkey, but you recently extended the casus belli to. Do you see now how you're a sponge for propaganda without even realising it? Be more careful with your media and your politicians.\n\n> I have no interest to argue more with some stupid nationalistic nutcase. You guys are all the same. That is why those bullshit newspapers are writing to increase paranoia, to sell you crazy people more.\n\nThe irony. For your information, I linked you a Turkish newspaper that says exactly what I'm accusing it of one or two comments ago. It's there. Open your eyes and read it.\n\n> No, you do not represent the Greek people at all. And these issues are gonna get solved with both parties comprise some, it is how it works. I guess you would not like it\n\nMy positions represent exactly those of the Greek people, the Greek government and of the international law, except maybe for the fact that I'm more open to a solution on the matter of Cyprus and I have more respect for Kemal Atat√ºrk (your last good politician and one of the best the world has to offer) than the average, although people still know that we won't get the solution we would like for Cyprus. But bullshit like this get me annoyed quite easily, just like everyone else.\n\nIn any case, the Greek state has not made a offensive movement against Turkey since 1975. No government has asked for what rightfully belongs to Turkey. The thing we do demand is to be left alone, at peace and to be given the right to exercise our international rights.",

When Greece bears part or all of the blame, I'm the first to admit it, be it a mess-up or a wrong action. Like our whole disagreement with the EU and especially Germany during the previous decade, where Greece messed up big time several times in a row to get to that condition. Greece has blame for the Cyprus issue (several mess-ups and at least one wrong action) and the 1922 defeat as well (several mess-ups). But here it doesn't.",

The specific mention of your hero about *nuclear* states invading non-nuclear ones clearly means that Turkey is allowed to do whatever it wants to its neighbours.

February 25, 2022 - RIA Novosti, 1920, 02/26/2022\n>¬© REUTERS / Valentyn Ogirenko\n>Petr Akopov all materials\n>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.\n\n>Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of an actual civil war, because now brothers, divided by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\n\n>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.\n\n>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kyiv), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that \"only Ukraine is the real Rus',\" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when \"we lost Ukraine.\" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum. And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossible - it would have to fight for it with the Atlantic bloc.\n\n>Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations\nNow this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.\n\n>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.\n\n>Did anyone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.\nMore precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is,\n\n>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.\n\n>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well ‚Äî in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.\n\n>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.\n\n>China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.\n\nGoogle translate as always loses some nuance but seriously look at this article every time you read whitewashing about Russian motives. This is the Russian government speaking to Russians after they assumed they had already won in Ukraine.",

    "content": "I've noticed a very strange propaganda tactic from the Russians recently. In between them calling Ukraine a made-up state and all of its people nazis, they sometimes go the complete other way and pretend they care more about Ukrainian lives than Russian ones.\n\nFor example, when describing Ukrainians defending Bakhmut, fighting from fortified positions with medical teams close by, they call it a \"meatgrinder\" and curse at young men being wounded and dying in combat. \n\nBut later, sometimes on the same page, they'll say \"we also attacked x city, with heavy losses and no gain\" and not elaborate. Showing no emotion at all that it is their own men, people their readers may know personally, being shot. It seemingly doesn't matter that the losses taken are greater than Ukraine's, due to the dangers of attacking fortified positions.\n\nIt's obvious that these are crocodile tears, but it's still weird to see the exact opposite of dehumanisation in war. I'd guess it's aimed at foreign audiences, hoping to turn westerners against sending military aid.",

    "content": "> \n> \n> Seven days after the invasion of Ukraine, Russian troops entered the village of Yahidne. They forced the residents out of their homes and into the basement of the local school, which they had turned into their headquarters. Until they withdrew on March 30, 2022, the Russians kept almost the entire population of Yahidne‚Äîmore than 360 people, including children and the elderly‚Äîin that basement for nearly a month.\n> \n> It was so cramped, people had to sleep sitting up. Instead of a toilet, there were buckets. Food had to be foraged. There was no ventilation, so the oldest went crazy and died. The Russians did not allow the dead to be buried immediately, and when they finally did, they fired on the funeral.\n> \n> ‚ÄúPeople jumped into the pit with the bodies,‚Äù says one six months later, recalling the ordeal, at a feast for those who emerged alive. Many had not.\n>\n> ----------------------------------------\n> \n> The Russians had claimed that they sent the villagers into the basement for their ‚Äúprotection,‚Äù but it was clear they were human shields. The Russian military made their headquarters on the two floors above.\n> \n> ----------------\n> \n> One time they brought bags of cereal and pasta. Valeriy wondered what brought on this gesture of goodwill. But when he took a closer look, he saw that the bags were leaking. They were transporting diesel fuel in the car, and it spilled on the bags of cereal. The people washed the pasta in water three times, boiled it, and ate it anyway.\n> \n> The most humiliating thing was going to the toilet. They were allowed to use the toilet outside only during the day. But you weren‚Äôt allowed to leave the basement at night. There were three buckets in the gym for about 150 people. People stopped drinking water in the evening to keep from having to use them.\n\n>\n> -----------------------\n>\n> Meanwhile, health conditions were deteriorating. There was an outbreak of chicken pox. People coughed from the lack of air and the dust. Many had a temperature. People‚Äôs legs swelled from sitting all the time; they had open sores. The Russians could have given them antiseptic or cough lozenges, but most often their response was ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt come here to treat you.‚Äù People continued to die, and when they did, their bodies were taken to the boiler room where the living went to wash.\n>\n> -----------------------------\n>\n>Olha the agronomist went to look at her house. It hadn‚Äôt burned down, that was good. But the windows were broken, the roof destroyed, there were puddles inside. There was no electricity or gas. In the middle of the living room was a pile of things the Russian soldiers had thrown around while they rummaged through the wardrobes. They had stolen all the warm clothes, men‚Äôs shoes, socks, tools‚Äîit was the same in most houses.\n\n>‚ÄúWe all said that as soon as we got out, we wouldn‚Äôt step foot in that basement,‚Äù recalls Olha.

Every Russian action you‚Äôve mentioned is just described as the result of American behavior.\n\n> [Assad] was a dictator who was slaughtering his own people. Are you aware of that?",

They have opposed the project for years, calling it a national security threat because it would allow Russia to sell gas more easily to Europe. Ukrainian government and military intelligence officials say they had no role in the attack and do not know who carried it out.\n\n>U.S. officials said there was much they did not know about the perpetrators and their affiliations. The review of newly collected intelligence suggests they were opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but does not specify the members of the group, or who directed or paid for the operation. U.S. officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or any details of the strength of the evidence it contains. They have said that there are no firm conclusions about it, leaving open the possibility that the operation might have been conducted off the books by a proxy force with connections to the Ukrainian government or its security services.\n\n>Some initial U.S. and European speculation centered on possible Russian culpability, especially given its prowess in undersea operations, though it is unclear what motivation the Kremlin would have in sabotaging the pipelines given that they have been an important source of revenue and a means for Moscow to exert influence over Europe. One estimate put the cost of repairing the pipelines starting at about¬†$500 million. U.S. officials say they have not found any evidence of involvement by the Russian government in the attack.\n\n>Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two. U.S. officials said no American or British nationals were involved.\n\n>The pipelines were¬†ripped apart by deep sea explosions in September, in what U.S. officials described at the time as an act of sabotage. European officials have publicly said they believe the operation that targeted Nord Stream was probably state sponsored, possibly because of the sophistication with which the perpetrators planted and detonated the explosives on the floor of the Baltic Sea without being detected. U.S. officials have not stated publicly that they believe the operation was sponsored by a state.\n\n>The explosives were most likely planted with the help of experienced divers who did not appear to be working for military or intelligence services, U.S. officials who have reviewed the new intelligence said. But it is possible that the perpetrators received specialized government training in the past.\n\n>Officials said there were still enormous gaps in what U.S. spy agencies and their European partners knew about what transpired. But officials said it might constitute the first significant lead to emerge from several closely guarded investigations, the conclusions of which could have profound implications for the coalition supporting Ukraine.\nAny suggestion of Ukrainian involvement, whether direct or indirect, could upset the delicate relationship between Ukraine and Germany, souring support among a German public that has swallowed high energy prices in the name of solidarity.\n\n>U.S. officials who have been briefed on the intelligence are divided about how much weight to put on the new information. All of them spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence and matters of sensitive diplomacy.\n\ne.

There is no credible reason to assume this policy will change under Putin or a successor. However, a Ceasefire or False Peace for 3 months to 3 years would be of incredible benefit to this policy. There are four primary problems hampering Russia‚Äôs ability war in Ukraine.  \n\n1. Logistics.  \n\n2. Lack of Air Superiority.  \n\n3. Command and Control. \n\n4. Most of the Russian Navy is not in Theater.  \n\nThe biggest problem is logistics. A three-month Ceasefire would be enough to fix many of logistics problems facing Russia.  As Russia is a bad faith actor trusting them to not exploit any ceasefire is a nonstarter for Ukraine. Currently Russian trains cannot get close to the front line due to HIMARS and Russian supply trucks are constantly targeted by insurgents and saboteurs.  \n\n[The opening of Lord of War demonstrates a Soviet Style supply chain.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVDyoCWz0vM) Please note the absence of forklifts. This is very important. Whether by boat or train everything is loaded and unloaded by hand or crane. This means concentration is greatly preferable to dispersion.  \n\nEvery step of the chain from the moment the Train or Boat enters Ukraine is vulnerable to partisans and saboteurs. Currently Russia cannot devote enough resources to crushing the resistance movement because the front line is so hot. That means everything from nails hidden in potholes, sabotaged rail lines, snipers, roadside bombs and reconnaissance constantly maintaining pressure on the supply lines.  \n\nFrom the moment the supply chain enters HIMARS range trains are a no go because of the vulnerability to precision strike. Russia must keep all their large depots well back from the front line then send small convoys with small batches of supply. This prevents them from building up the necessary supply to launch a proper 30 000 strong Soviet Style offensive.  \n\nNow that Russia knows what they need, *which they did not know before the war*, they can build up the necessary materiel to do a proper job of it. Then use continued terrorist and partisan attacks in Ukraine or another false flag to have another go.  \n\nNext biggest problem is lack of Air Superiority. Fixing the Russian Air Force will probably take 3 years of intensive retraining.  Can go into detail if anyone is interested \n\nCommand and control could be improved quite a lot in 3 months, 3 years is more reasonable. Again, I can provide details as required. \n\nIn a ‚ÄúFalse Peace‚Äù Russia could transfer the deadliest parts of the Navy to the Black Sea they are currently locked out by Turkey.  \n\nSo what does this all mean? It means anyone proposing a ceasefire without the Russian withdrawal is doing the geopolitical equivalent of telling a rape victim they need to cohabitate with their rapist and remove the lock on their bedroom door. Constant pressure on Russian supply chains is preventing a military catastrophe in Ukraine, Ukraine cannot stop and will not stop until they win or they cannot fight.",

The bulk of the interview is talking about Iraq with two Iraqi intellectuals, and it‚Äôs very much worth reading for perspective on war in general. The DN hosts steered it to the ICC at the end so don‚Äôt blame the guests, the interview is excellent without this last bit. \n\n> NERMEEN SHAIKH: Sinan, thank you. That‚Äôs a very moving and beautiful poem. Now, we‚Äôre speaking as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has entered its second year, and we‚Äôve just heard now that the International Criminal Court has called for the arrest of Putin as a war criminal. Now, the U.S. took many steps to ensure ‚Äî has taken, that its own officials and military would be protected from any such attempts by the International Criminal Court or any other international body from facing such allegations. If you could respond to that ‚Äî I mean, we‚Äôve just been talking about the use of chemical weapons ‚Äî and the fact that no one has been charged with war crimes?\n\nSINAN ANTOON: Well, I also want to go back to 1991 ‚Äî\n\nFEURAT ALANI: Yes. And ‚Äî oh, sorry.\n\nSINAN ANTOON: Oh, sorry. I didn‚Äôt know. Sorry, I thought it was me. Go ahead.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: No, Sinan Antoon. If you could please respond, Sinan?\n\nSINAN ANTOON: You know, the depleted uranium was already used in 1991 and caused catastrophic consequences for Iraqi citizens, especially in Basra, for example, and the skyrocketing cancer rates. But also there were war crimes were committed in 1991 in so-called Desert Storm. There are horrific images of how the U.S. bombed withdrawing Iraqi troops from Kuwait. It‚Äôs called the Highway of Death. And there was only one American journalist who took those images. And I think there was a ‚Äî most media outlets did not show them because they were too horrific.\n\nBut, you know, there are double and triple standards in so-called international law. And as we can see, of course, the law is weaponized when it serves the interests, because, by any measure, Bush, Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Rumsfeld, they‚Äôre all war criminals, but, of course, they will not be put on trial. And I think, actually, Bush cannot travel internationally, because he, you know, might face consequences.\n\nSo, I mean, the attitudes, especially of Americans, but of a lot of Europeans, to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in so many ways just shows the double standards and also the hierarchy of human worth that a lot of people on this planet believe in ‚Äî who really is a full human being that you can empathize with, you know, because ‚Äúthey look like us,‚Äù quote-unquote, or because they are European from a certain part of Europe also, and whose death really doesn‚Äôt count, whether they‚Äôre Palestinian or Yemeni or Syrian or Iraqi or Afghani, whose death doesn‚Äôt even register. And a million deaths becomes just a statistic, because they are not viewed as having lived full lives, because their lives do not resemble our lives.\n\nSo, you know, Putin is considered a war criminal, but we live in a country where war criminals are still going around, appearing on TV, dancing on the Ellen DeGeneres show, and, you know, Bush talks about his paintings. And also, when these war criminals die, as with Rumsfeld, you know, there isn‚Äôt even a mention of the catastrophic consequences of their decisions, that as we talk now about depleted uranium, this is in the unborn babies. This is in the wombs of mothers. This is in the air and in the soil, and it will always be there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And let‚Äôs put the same question to Feurat Alani. As President Putin has been indicted for war crimes on this 20th anniversary of the Bush invasion, the U.S. invasion of Iraq, do you feel that President George W. Bush, that Dick Cheney and other high-level U.S. government officials should be charged with war crimes for what happened to your country, to Iraq?\n\nFEURAT ALANI: Yes. And as Sinan mentioned, the list of crimes is very long, especially about Iraq, but not only Iraq. It was funny to see the reaction of Joe Biden talking about the ICC going after Putin, when Joe Biden said something like, ‚ÄúYes, this is great.‚Äù But at the same time, he said, ‚ÄúBut us, the U.S.A., we don‚Äôt recognize the ICC.‚Äù And we know why. Bush would be on the list. A lot of people would be on the list. Even if we can see similarities, of course, with the invasion of Ukraine by Putin and Iraq at that time, on the illegal aspect, on the aggression, of international law ‚Äî\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We have 10 seconds.\n\nFEURAT ALANI: ‚Äî it‚Äôs very important to remind ‚Äî very important to remind that Bush should be judged, and it‚Äôs not acceptable that he‚Äôs still joking about Iraq.",

    "content": "> # Amid Russia-Ukraine war, small countries like Singapore must keep a sober mind and look beyond headlines: Shanmugam\n\n> LESSONS\n\n> Responsibilities\n\n> I mentioned at the start, there are different views on how we got here and to what extent those countries are responsible for the current situation.\n\n> Whatever the case, Ukraine is the unfortunate victim, and its people are paying a terrible price.\n\n> Minsk, NATO enlargement, how NATO enlargement was done ‚Äì swiftly, in spite of Russia‚Äôs repeated and consistent protests ‚Äì can in no way justify an invasion.\n\n> But we also have to understand why a not insignificant number of Russians are fully convinced that Russia‚Äôs invasion is justified, and that Russia has been the victim of Western aggression.\n\n> The West has to reflect on whether Russia‚Äôs concerns were adequately dealt with, even as NATO expanded.\n\n> The West and NATO, in my view, were not uninvolved bystanders who had no role to play in the current situation.\n\n> Lessons for Small Countries\n\n> In the chessboard of Great Power Rivalry, what is the lesson for small countries, like Singapore?\n\n> Entangled in these historical events, are two important principles of international law.\n\n> First, Indivisible Security: A state should not enhance its security at the expense of another‚Äôs. Because one state‚Äôs security is inseparably linked to another‚Äôs.\n\n> The second principle, Self-Determination. In this context, the right of a state to choose its own military and political alliances.\n\n> Now, I make three observations on these two principles.\n\n> First, the two principles can contradict each other. One country‚Äôs self-determined source of security can be another country‚Äôs source of insecurity.\n\n> Second, you can argue from an international law perspective, on the inviolability of a country‚Äôs sovereignty. But, given a contradiction, each Power will pick one of these principles best suited for their interests, in that particular geopolitical context.\n\n> In the context of today‚Äôs conflict, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has referred frequently to the indivisibility of security. He insists that Ukraine should not strengthen its security (by joining NATO) at the expense of Russia‚Äôs security. On the other hand, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has repeatedly affirmed that the right of Ukraine to choose its own security arrangements and alliances is a core principle that the US is committed to defend. So, the United States asserts Ukraine‚Äôs right to self-determination, while Russia asserts the principle of indivisible security. Ukraine‚Äôs security should not be at the expense of Russia‚Äôs security.\n\n> Let‚Äôs go back to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. We see the reverse.\n\n> Back then, when it was Cuba that was potentially posing a threat to the US, US President John F Kennedy spoke about halting Cuba‚Äôs offensive build-up of weapons in, I quote, ‚Äúdefense of our own security‚Äù, as they were, ‚Äúa threat to world peace‚Äù.\n\n> In response, Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev dismissed America‚Äôs actions as, ‚Äúundisguised interference‚Äù in the internal affairs of Cuba. In other words, Cuba is sovereign, and Cuba should be allowed to decide for itself.\n\n> So, when it came to Cuba, America emphasised the principle of indivisible security, and Russia emphasised the principle of sovereignty. The complete reversal is happening today. Both then, and now, neither Great Power accepted a potential threat at its doorstep.\n\n> I think it‚Äôs fair to say that in the future, these sorts of dynamics will continue. And both Great Powers cited the relevant principle that best suited them, to the position they wished to take.\n\n> Big countries do that frequently.\n\n> A third and final observation ‚Äì small countries often pay a disproportionate price in geopolitical conflicts among Great Powers.\n\n> Depending on how you look at it, smaller countries can be said to have been either wilfully used as pawns, or just inadvertently caught between the powers, as collateral damage.\n\n> But there is no mistake that they are often the ones who pay the price.\n\n> Looking at the past few decades of conflict and tension between Russia and the West, it is the Ukrainians who are paying the price.\n\n> One thing about Ukraine is clear though. Its defence has been nothing short of heroic against a vastly superior power. A war that many thought would be over in days, has stretched to more than a year. Ukraine‚Äôs sense of national identity, purpose, and independence have now been forged in steel and blood. Whoever might have queried the artificiality of Ukraine as a state before the war, will have no doubts today that Ukraine‚Äôs sense of nationalism and statehood is completely formed. Ukraine‚Äôs spirit has become immeasurably stronger, and it is unlikely to be rolled over. There is a lot to admire about the way Ukraine has defended itself.\n\n> For small countries like Singapore, it is in our interest to have regional\n\n> structures that promote cooperation rather than rivalry in our region.\n\n> And understand that ultimately, we have to have the military means ourselves, and the social resilience, so that we can defend ourselves. Because others may help only if it suits their interests.\n\n> It is also critical for us to have a keen eye, keep a sober mind, and maintain a sharp analysis towards competitive geopolitical trends.\n\n> We have to look beyond the bluster, the headlines, and the ideologically-driven narratives, to understand the facts.\n\n> And finally, we must continue, as we always have, to act only and always in Singapore‚Äôs own interests, and stand up for the principles on which our interests are based. But it cannot just be self-interest. There must be basis in international law for these interests.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/redditporean/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/redditporean/sneakpeek)",

Didn‚Äôt Ukraine look out for its own interests? I don‚Äôt think one can blame the collective West for igniting the conflict - the issue was the Ukrainians themselves who no longer wanted to live in the Russian sphere of influence anymore. They saw how the baltics and the former Warsaw Pact became integrated into EU and NATO. They probably saw much more opportunity going into the Western sphere than to try to balance between Europe and Russia. So what‚Äôs the point to be made here - that countries can no longer look out for their own valid interests that are within the bounds of international law? \n\nAs an aside the Cuban Missile Crisis is a terrible example to make a comparison.

    "content": "I'd suggest that the Cuban Missile Crisis is far more applicable to the Ukraine situation at present than you give it credit. Consider the Bay of Pigs invasion and Operation Mongoose - from Cuba's perspective, the US was the aggressor; very much like how from Ukraine's perspective, Russia is the aggressor starting with Crimea. \n\nThe Soviets offered to deploy missiles in Cuba; and the Cubans accepted - unsurprisingly, because it's in Cuba's sovereign interest to obtain defensive and deterrent capabilities, especially given that there had been actual invasion and state-sponsored terrorism conducted by the US against Cuba. With regard to Ukraine and NATO - there may be some grey as to whether NATO/US flirted with Ukraine to join NATO, or if Ukraine sought NATO membership independently - but either way, Ukraine acted in its own sovereign interest to seek to exit Russian sphere of influence. \n\nThe concessions that resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis involved the US publicly recognising Cuba's sovereignty and promising \"not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba\". In exchange, both the US and the Soviet Union withdrew and redeployed warheads and missiles placed both in Cuba and elsewhere. From Cuba's perspective, it was outraged, seeing it as a betrayal by the Soviet Union. \n\nIf the US/Europe and Russia came to a resolution on the conflict, I would posit that it is more than likely that Ukraine would similarly, and fairly, see this as a US/European betrayal. (But - as unlikely as Putin is to emulate JFK, *if* that option was on the table, would it be unreasonable for the US/West to take it?)\n\nI've written the above from the perspective of the patsy/true victim in both scenarios - Cuba and Ukraine. They acted in their sovereign interests, clearly, but bigger players had different interests. That is the lesson for Singapore, because we're small and would, in a similar conflict, likely end up as a Cuba or a Ukraine, rather than as a US or Russia/Soviet Union. \n\nTurning away from the \"small state\" perspective, what has yet to be determined are the following:-\n\nA) What are the US/Western interests in this conflict? \nB) How are these interests in parallel with or diverge from the Soviet interests in the Cuban Missile Crisis? \nC) Following from the assessment at #B, what is the end-game in this conflict? \n\nIf the answer to #C is, as per your comment about not giving the Russians anything here - then the US/Western interest is \"total victory over the Russians\". We then have to accept that nuclear annihilation as credible - both logically, and well as in line with the precedent that is the Cuban Missile Crisis (*as nuclear annihilation was the likely outcome had the US and the Soviet Union not reach mutual agreement*). \n\n(Indeed, one would argue that if the Soviet Union and Cuba had adopted the same perspective of achieving total victory over the US, that would've been absolutely justifiable. After all, the US *had* invaded and conducted state-sponsored terrorism against Cuba. There was not merely actual threat, but crystalised conflict. The Cubans clearly believed that risking nuclear war was worth it - else they would not feel betrayed.)\n\nAnd so, the caution that is put out there (and unfairly tarred as being \"pro-Russia\") is this - \"is this worth nuclear annihilation?\" \n\nIf no, then it is incumbent on all to discover an off-ramp to get the world off this path. \n\nIf yes, the hawks have to at least justify *why* is this worth nuclear annihilation, and distinguish the present situation from the Cuban Missile Crisis. This is not a self-evident premise, because nuclear annihilation is not limited to the direct players involved in this conflict.",

There can be no foreign policy doctrine based on the idea that a neutral country trying to join a defensive treaty comparable in anyway to a hostile country inviting nuclear armed ballistic missiles to be placed on their soil and thus subjecting another country to annihilation with essentially no reaction time.   \n\n\nIf these two things are equivalent and all national self determination occurs in the context of the security requirements of other states, then what he is saying is that we essentially cannot enter treaties that displease anyone around us, because joining even purely defensive treaties might be interpreted by them as the equivalent of us putting their national leadership and key population centers within 5 minutes of a nuclear ballistic missile strike. This is an idea that ensures that our sovereignty is subject to the whims of our least reasonable and most violent large neighbor. This incentivizes countries that don't like us to be unreasonable and violent. This is clearly a nonsense and taken to its logical conclusion contradicts everything that the government has previously said about National sovereignty and the existential requirements of small states.   \n\n\nIt is far more likely that this talk is for a segment of confused PAP supporters that heavily features people who support extremist authoritarian positions, are often a bit seditiously pro-PRC, worryingly pro Putin and who are petulantly unhappy that defending a rules based international order and defending international principles secure us means siding with the 'librul' west to defend a aspiring liberal democracy against an authoritarian human rights abuser imperialist partner of the PRC.   \n\n\nI seem to recall that the previous PAP tactic for calming these confused people down was for PAP figures to assure them that Ukraine would eventually lose this war and that these people should forgive the necessity that Singapore defends key principles that underpin its sovereignty because 'the librul west is going to lose anyway'. So now, that we are a year in and Russia looks incapable of taking small towns in Luhansk and that the best case scenario, from their POV, is multi-year devastating attrition that Russia gets the worst of.  I think the pivot is going to be towards rhetoric that can be summarized as : \" We need to defend our sovereignty, but we agree with you confused people that this all the result of the librul west's alternative naivete/black-handed machinations ( change when it is suitable for the narrative).\"   \n\n\nShan would be the ideal person to talk nonsense like this as the former foreign minister who is already well used to bashing the 'librul' west in every speech.",

Singapore is going to anticipate being dragged in to a future US-China conflict, and his Lesson #2 is saying, we know the US and China will try to get us to side on one side over the other, and we are going to pre-empt this instead of being in an uneviable situation of having to take sides. His allusion of US / USSR switching sides is just to say, events will happen in the SCS and/or Taiwan and both powers will point to these principles and ask SG to make a stand, and we should be aware and stand our ground of being neutral, not because we are principled but it truly benefits us to remain neutral. \n\n\n2. Singapore's warning to its regional neighbours (mainly ASEAN) is that we're all small countries and will suffer the most if China-US tensions rise, so we need stronger regional mechanisms.\n\n\n\n3. We stand by our original statement on Russia-Ukraine: an unjust invasion, but not wholly aligned with the way the U.S. and the West views it (ie not democracy vs authoritarianism, recognising Russian security needs), and therefore not necessarily sanctioning Russia at the same level other Asian allies are (e.g. ROK, Japan)\n\n\n4.

You could suggest that there are things that are worth risking nuclear annihilation and attempt to justify the point (I've certainly left that open, pointing to the Cuban reaction to the resolution of the Missile Crisis). \n\nOr...

A Korean style armistice could at least provide enough cover for all parties to reengage with the peace process.\n\nOr... You could admit that there is no endgame in your mind - to which at least everyone would be clear that peace is, in your mind, not an achievable outcome. Let people decide how best to weigh your words, given your premises and perspectives.\n\nWords are supposed to matter. But I suppose this is Reddit.\n\nEdit: To anyone else who's made it down here - yes, I'm aware that these options are largely off the table, because the UN is neutered due to the Security Council. But (I) perhaps the US will now be reminded that internationalism has its upside (e.g. a fig leaf to go into a conflict zone to enforce peace without initiating interstate war); and (II) perhaps people can then truly internalise the notion that there are no such things as solutions, only tradeoffs.\n\nThere is no perfect solution to the Ukrainian conflict. The moment the US/West decide to stop providing weapons, Ukraine will be on a very short clock to sue for peace. If Zelensky is far sighted, he has to realise that his country's survival is contingent on the whims of a country one ocean away. It's incumbent on him to keep a cool head and figure out what are the acceptable permutations of outcomes - and steer towards them.\n\nLikewise - any small nation should learn the lesson, that depending on the goodwill/temporary alignment of interests of a larger power for security is a very risky proposition. The idea that countries will swoop in to save Singapore (because, e.g., they have their money here) is nonsense.

(Of course this is a pretty shallow reading of the stance)\n\nOf course SG would prefer if China doesn't militarize it, but its hands are tied over this specific issue due to its current stance (it's not like we could walk it back today without blowback from China, contrary to what others may feel). I.e. I don't think where SG stands re \"Russian self-defence logic\" can meaningfully impact the discussion on the Spratlys.\n\nAs to Philippines and Vietnam (and the other claimants)...now that's an ASEAN issue that they uhh ought to get their act on. Many ASEAN countries are not as anti-Russia as we are (mainly because their military equipment are Russian and maintenance will be a problem if they suddenly lose their rship with Russia). See [this article](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/the-us-russia-vietnam-triangle-decoding-hanois-strategic-balancing/) on Vietnam's conundrum regarding their tricky balancing act on Russia. \n\nThe logic (not my personal opinion, just working off foreign policy principles that SG has) is also this: if our ASEAN neighbours who have more to lose aren't denouncing Russian logic (and won't for a while), why should we denounce it when it serves us utility (chiefly putting space between us and the US, i.e. signalling to China that we aren't going to be wholly US allied and to the US that we will not support you all the way to implement newer sanctions beyond what we already have) and the risk of China adopting that logic isn't going to be dependent on what we do anyway?\n\ntl;dr: MFA probably thinks that there's more gain right now and less downside to the Russian logic piece.",

Or do we have the same standard for both?  Because if China entered military alliances in central America such that they had military bases and ICBMs on Mexico's southern border, and you don't think the US would invade at the drop of a hat, then you lack even a tenuous understanding of the actual history of 20th (and 21st century) US hegemony.",

The Bay of Pigs was an attempt by the US to use anti-Castro Cubans to overthrow their own government, it involved 1500 men and when it failed the US did not attempt an actual invasion using US troops. The US could have easily invaded and conquered Cuba if it wanted to, we all know that.\n\nAlso, idk why you would assume that I support US foreign policy on Cuba, Vietnam, or any of those other disasters.

    "content": "> The question is simple: do we hold Russia to a standard higher than that to which we hold the US government? Or do we have the same standard for both?  Because if China entered military alliances in central America such that they had military bases and ICBMs on Mexico's southern border, and you don't think the US would invade at the drop of a hat, then you lack even a tenuous understanding of the actual history of 20th (and 21st century) US hegemony.\n\nThis is the standard: right now, in the 21st century, under the obligations of myriad treaties, agreements, norms, etc., states *ought* not invade other states absent a strong moral justification. Just because this standard has been violated in the past, is being violated currently, and may continue to be violated in the future, it does not necessarily follow that the standard should be lowered. The fact that some states may escape legal repercussions and punishments for violating the standard does not mean the standard ought to be lowered. *Hypothetically*, in this *astronomically unlikely* event where the current diplomatic relations and state behaviour are completely upended, and China wants to put *ICBMs in Mexico* (which is, again, a world so dramatically disparate to the world we have now that evaluating the counterfactual is truly impossible to do), the fact that the US *may* respond in a manner similar to Russia in this bizarre *counterfactual* does not mean the standard ought to be lowered. \n\nIt should all be condemned. For how many more decades is it reasonable to continuously refer to the Cuban Missile Crisis as if the world has remained completely static since then?",

My point is that if you say that Russia's only intension was to secure the break-off regions then why would they spend all those recourse trying to take the most heavy fortified part of Ukraine it's doesn't make sense based on those war goals.  The answer is that wasn't there original war goal.  There war goal was to overthrow Ukraine entirely not just get the regions of Donbass and luhansk or what ever the fuck it's called.",

The offensive began on May 12, 1898, when the United States Navy attacked the capital, San Juan. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans were able to establish a blockade in the city's harbor, San Juan Bay. On June 22, the cruiser Isabel II and the destroyer Terror delivered a Spanish counterattack, but were unable to break the blockade and Terror was damaged.\n \n**[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Hawaiian_Kingdom)** \n \n >The overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was a coup d'√©tat against Queen Lili ªuokalani, which took place on January 17, 1893, on the island of Oahu and led by the Committee of Safety, composed of seven foreign residents and six Hawaiian Kingdom subjects of American descent in Honolulu. The Committee prevailed upon American minister John L. Stevens to call in the U.S. Marines to protect the national interest of the United States of America. The insurgents established the Republic of Hawaii, but their ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which occurred in 1898.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PKA/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Lets not forget that Russia is one of the wests main opponents globally, so being able to slowly (or not so slowly) bleed them dry is a huge plus, strategically speaking.\n\nRussia was widely regarded as the worlds \"second military\" prior to this conflict, nobody thinks this anymore. They are at best a third rate power now. \n\nI guess it does make sense to not want to support them if you are an isolationist. But I think Isolationism is a really bad idea, so obviously im not gonna agree with that.",

But the Avengers along with all the man portable should be able to exact a steep toll on Russian aviation.\n\nAnd let us not forget despite what I feel is a mainly propaganda orientation to this announcement Russia has a real problem with qualified pilots, and the fact that their most valuable assets such as KA-52s, SU-25s and SU-30s and 34s have already seen some notable attrition.  They have lost more then 25% of their KA-52 fleet, and 15% of some of the others.

I don't like saying the Russians are simply stupid as is easy to do, but are often influenced by reasons we might not understand (though admittedly some of these actions simply can't be explained any other way than terribly stupid mistakes).\n\nNot many expected Russia to invade Ukraine, because most people understood it would be a mistake. Russia did anyway. \n\nWhen it was clear they were not winning, instead of cutting their losses they just started to refocus on the Donbass. \n\nRussia relied heavily on it's military hardware while it did not have enough manpower to avoid mobilization. Then it mobilized anyway and is now conserving equipment. \n\nWhen it seemed logical for Russia to cease offensive actions during the winter to build up and train it's newly mobilized forces, it instead continued relentless assaults on Bakmut.\n\nIf Russia is willing to use newly mobilized infantry in largely unsupported attacks that are seen to cause significant losses for comparatively little gain, I see no reason they wouldn't start using their last largely untapped resource. It makes little sense and would come at a cost almost everyone would agree is exceptionally high, but there is a kind of logic to it. It would be consistent with Russia's repeated decisions to focus on short term gains over long term success. It's possible this may pay off, but I just don't see how that's very likely. \n\nIt vaguely reminds me of Operation Ten-Go where the largest battleship ever made (Yamato) was sent on a useless suicide mission largely because of a political slight by the Japanese Emperor toward the Japanese Navy. The operation made no sense militarily, but at least did serve the purpose of helping to keep the honor of the Japanese Navy (whatever that was worth at the end of the war).\n\nAt the end of the day simply saying it doesn't appear to make any sense, doesn't mean the Russians won't try it.",

    "content": "Unlikely. Though the ammo situation is pretty bad and is slowly being resolved, there is still enough to reliably shoot down a fair amount of Russian jets and helicopters in short order with the numbers flying missions that Russia is planning. That might be enough of a blow to give the Russian Air force pause and disrupt proper CAS sorties during Russian Offensives.\n\nThe drones are a problem for sure but not an insurmountable one. Allies have been supplying a decent amount of heavy machine guns with thermal imaging to provide a cheaper alternative to countering UAVs. \n\nThough the RAF has only sustained 6% losses in aircraft since the start of war we can easily predict that number jumping up to 20% or more. \n\nVisually confirmed losses so far:\n*Russia - 302, of which: destroyed: 203, damaged: 15, captured: 84\n \nCombat Aircraft (66, of which destroyed: 63, damaged: 3)*\n\nSource: [Oryx](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/03/list-of-aircraft-losses-during-2022.html?m=1)\n\nLet's not forget as well:\n\n\n*\"It was thought that Russia would quickly be able to assume aerial authority over Ukraine, allowing the Kremlin to pick off Ukrainian defences at will and paving the way for a successful land invasion. Their failure in this regard is largely due to the scale and the sophistication of Ukraine‚Äôs aerial defences which have prevented Russia from gaining a foothold. Fearing that an invasion was on the cards Ukrainian officials dispersed the nation's air-defence system, making them harder to find and providing greater defensive coverage.\"*\n\n[Source](https://en.as.com/en/2022/03/11/latest_news/1646953335_806897.html)\n\nIf Russia, with a much larger advantage in February/March, couldn't achieve air superiority due to \"the scale and the sophistication of Ukraine‚Äôs aerial defences\" at the time there is no reason to believe they will be able to do that now. Ukraine's AA has only gotten larger and more sophisticated with US AWACS and superior NATO intel.\n\nIt is possible for Russia to actually get a break through here like you said. But is it probable? I doubt it. The numbers just don't add up. This is their last chance to attempt to achieve Air Superiority with the additional AA being sent in the next month or so. After that they can seriously just forget about running sorties over Ukraine.\n\n\nEdit 1&2: grammar and formatting.\n\nEdit 3: can't into grammar again.",

Most people are Pro-Ukraine (obligatory Fuck Putin by the way), but I see a lot of people buying into Putin's narrative that this is all the United States fault and so on. Reminder that this  is all based on how I feel, but again *I feel like* French people are much more inclined to be conspiracy theorists. We had a lot of anti-mask, anti-vax people when COVID was going on, that kind of shit.\n\nI guess it's due to how our democracy function. The people who we elect, can basically run wild and do whatever the hell they want. And you may say that it's the case everywhere... yes, but more so in France then the typical European democracy. That's because to how our Republic function and so on but that is a whole other thing. \n\nBut to give you an example, we're seeing this currently with the whole age of retirement issue. Pretty much everyone is against it, but our government is forcing it regardless, to the point of forcing things on to our National Assembly and purposefully limiting the debates. They decided that it will be this way and therefore, it will be. Democracy be damned. Our current President said that we voted for him not because we liked him but because we had no other choice (it was him or the far right) and now, he is like: *\"Why are you complaining? You voted for me, you knew what you were getting.\"*\n\nAll of this contributes to a constant climate of defiance about our politicians, but also the press because lots of people feel like it's constantly trying to support our government. Let's just say that basically, we seem to have massive trust issues and therefore a strong tendency to not only distrust, but reject the opinion of the press and of our politicians.\n\nOf course, it doesn't help that the \"Rassemblement National\", a far right political party with massive influence that keeps growing (it's really big in France, like 'we have to mobilise our votes to prevent it from getting power' big) is basically a Puppet. \n\nIt's absolutely not the majority. But it's strongly there. For example, if you go and look at a video talking about the situation with the war that is uploaded by mainstream press on YouTube, the comments will be fucking horrendous. How many of that are Russian bots? That's a whole other question. But it's there, in much stronger way then I see elsewhere.",

About the far right extremists, on top of that they fall for the Russian propaganda of the strong alpha male as a commander (Putin), the anti gay lgbt ideology and the holy Russia fighting against all this woke and \"decadent\" West.\n\nThat said, I also believe that America fucked up badly after 1991, and should be aware of that because it was a seed that contributed to the situation we know today. \n\nAlso I don't like the attitude of many Americans and British who decide which countries are good and which are bad in their support to Ukraine. NATO is one of the reasons why the EU doesn't have an army and why Europeans cannot contribute as much as they'd like to help Ukraine. Now one can only acknowledge the importance of NATO but the downside of it is the heavy reliance of European countries on USA's army. Also they shouldn't forget that Europeans are suffering way more than Americans from this war.",

    "content": "To paraphrase pen ultimate comedian George Carlin \" here's an individual that very likely should be dragged from his bed and beaten to death with shovels under the cover of moonlight. \"\n\nOkay! I feel like I have enough ground to stand on to chime in here. For brief context I come from a heavy militarized family: mostly US Navy. So I have an idea about how these particular military actions are performed. While I was unable to serve myself, pretty much everyone else has.\n\nThe US Vietnam conflict is noteworthy for its in your face gritty filming of the event. Considering at that point that the United States was basically leading the world in media production, it's only natural that the United States is going to want to lead the charge in this particular avenue. What this individual in the body of the text is really failing to capitalize on, is there have actually been moments where filming things have actually caused people to die. And I'm not even talking the film crews!\n\nSo I'm old enough to remember the Falkland Islands incident firsthand. For those of you that don't know there was a conflict between the United Kingdom and Argentina. This conflict was a fight over the Falkland Islands. England was in a complete Tiff and was about to invade. So at one point I think it was CNN, was interviewing this English colonel. At one point he's asked a series of questions including what was the plan. The man then goes and points to a map and he begins saying things such as where troops are going to be deployed and when and the movements that they're going to be making in vivid detail. What this absolute moron didn't think of was that anybody in the Argentinian government had access to cable. Oh they very much did! To put this in perspective for people that may not truly understand how this works, is imagine you are watching the super bowl. The coach of the Kansas City Chiefs is showing the playbook to his guys. The camera clearly shows the playbook for us the audience. But now imagine that the Philadelphia Eagles coach is holding his cell phone in his hand, and he's watching the stream of the event and then giving callouts and audibles to his team in real time. That is exactly what happened in the Falkland Islands.\n\nSo really after that incident and Operation desert Storm, I've come to notice that in the field footage of action has generally diminished to a few shots. Likewise, fake Air raid sirens? You know what the problem is with those people who think the air raid sirens are fake, is it likely never heard one fired off in Earnest in their life. I have! Multiple times. If one has even a basic, elementary understanding of acoustics, and an understanding of how sound behaves around certain buildings made of certain substances, you can tell that that is not fake. And then here's the ultimate question: why fake it then? What is the point of faking an air raid siren going off in an area that you can literally look up on Google maps and see is currently being bombarded. You can see the smoke and the craters from space. So why fake it?\n\nThis person is so ultimately out of touch with reality, that they just don't understand. I mean, do you know how many years for example that it is been since a sitting US president has actually led the US military from the front lines? So what did it exactly are you expecting Joe Biden to do? Are you expecting him to suit up? Are you expecting him to go out there in full tactical gear? Are you expecting him to go out and what is tantamount to the Juggernaut armor from call of duty? Are you expecting him to pick up an m4 carbine and go charging in a battle right alongside president zelinsky? Were you perhaps expecting for bullets to go whizzing over the head of the president while he's talking with zelinsky? Are you hoping for that full metal jacket experience with a camera crew walks by the people that are currently engaged in artillery fire against insurgents? This seems to be an individual who has gotten most of their information ironically from the media.\n\nLook, I know I have a tendency to be very long winded, but that's just how my brain works. I'm not exactly sure what this guy wants to see! What would they possibly need to see in order to legitimize the conflict? It keeps going back to what I have called the Golden question: why? Specifically why concoct a fake war? I'm not even going to take the time to break down the complications of falsifying a war for any reason.\n\nI will say this much! If this absolute wackadoodle is simply attempting to imply that this is a false flag operation, then I would be ever so happy to point out that the entire us Vietnam conflict begin with a legitimate false flag operation. Namely when we fired upon our own naval vessel right next to a small collection of Vietnamese vessels in order to generate public outrage and send our soldiers and troops to join others in Vietnam. Yep. Pretty much 10 years of war in Vietnam all started because we shot ourselves.",

I just went and took a look at the interview notes, unless the translation has gone very wrong, the Pope is open to visiting Moscow, but not Kyiv, and he also says that the barking of NATO to russia's door might have provoked Russia. I really don't know what to say, I'll try to find the interview video, if these were the real words of the pope, I'm out.  \n\n\nI know it sounds provocative but at this point, I'm not closed to the idea that russia might have blackmail material on a bunch of high-level people in the institution of the Vatican.",

It's still the same bastion of toxic conservatism, homofobia and hidden pedophilia. \n\nThe Catholic church loves Putin because of his anti-lgbt crusade. Period.\n\nRemember when of all the victims of this war, pope Francis chose to publicly say he was praying for Darya Dugina? It's not random, it's feeding the fire of right wing extremism because he knows Dugin is followed by a lot fascists in the west.\n\n Disgusting man from a disgusting organization. \nA few years ago this was the great hope to reform the church... I hope people have learned something.",

I think the return to that ideology is still tempered by an obvious determination to avoid nuclear war, but defensive war is looking more legitimate, western/democratic military alliances are looking necessary, old critiques of dictatorships as intrinsically imperialistic, corrupt and unstable are looking correct, appeasing them is becoming unpalatable, etc.\n\nThese sorts of shifts have happened many times‚Äîthe last shift to realism/pacifism was largely inspired by the debacle of the Iraq/Afghan War plus the shadow of Vietnam. But now in the face of Russia‚Äôs open war of conquest and a Ukrainian national democratic defense those examples aren‚Äôt seeming so useful, while WWII ones are.

Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas War. The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, the conflict saw a major escalation as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe \"Russian POV\" or rather, Russian \"talking point,\" currently, seems to be meta. It's not claims about what did or didn't happen in 2014. The \"RU POV\" claim seems to be that the  \"The West\" claims nothing happened in 2014.\n\nThe reality is that no one denies what Stoltenberg says. It's not controversial. Ukrainians certainly insist on reminding commentators that the war actually started in 2014",

After other twitter users pointed out the original recording and blatant manipulation, the people who spread the disinfo didn't even delete their original tweets - just a short \"I stand corrected\" mention with no relation to the problem at hand, while the fake claim still got thousands of retweets and likes. As somewhat of a rightwing person myself I'm flabbergasted how many westerners(both in the EU and US) actually believe that russia is a defender of conservative values fighting against evil global elites, which obviously is total hogwash spread by all kinds of crazies the likes of antivaxxers and conspiracy nutjobs. Anyone who ever lived near russian borders knows it's literally the anti-civilization compared to the current western status-quo.",

EUvsDisinfo has over 500 examples of statements in pro-Kremlin outlets, containing the words ‚ÄúThere is no proof‚Äù. In the pro-Kremlin ecosystem, ‚Äúno proof‚Äù means ‚Äúno proof we accept‚Äù. Any evidence, not in line with the Kremlin narratives, does not exist. Evidence, be that witness accounts, hard evidence, poison residue, photos or videos, or even detained individuals are ‚Äúno proof‚Äù. Any individual, NGO or authority, forwarding data that raises questions about the Russian authorities‚Äô accountability or links it to crimes, is, according to the Kremlin, biased and the evidence has no value. Even the United Nations is biased against Russia and Belarus.\n\nA special case of denial is Russia‚Äôs persistent repudiation of deploying military units in Crimea in the spring of 2014, suggesting that the military there were local activists, purchasing equipment at army surplus stores. President Putin later acknowledged that the personnel were from Russian regular units, brought to Crimea to control the ‚Äúreferendum‚Äù.\n\nDenial, despite mountains of evidence, can be effective, especially if combined with other tricks from the rhetorical toolbox.\"\n\n[https://euvsdisinfo.eu/modus-trollerandi-part-7-denial/](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/modus-trollerandi-part-7-denial/)",

When I was in college there was a summer I was super invested in [dumb 2012 Planet X bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBpcZtJ-IIY). \n\nEvery now and then I try to think about *why* I got caught up in that nonsense and the best answer I can think of is that I was just unsatisfied. At the time I discovered these videos I was just entering college and had begun an IT-related major. My life, as I knew it, was kind of already laid out. I would graduate, get a job, retire, then die in my small hometown. Imagine going to go watch a movie that you already knew the beginning, middle, and end of; it just seemed boring but at the same time I also had a gut feeling it *had* to be that way. \n\nThen, suddenly, I found tons of videos telling me that *everything* I ever knew was going to change in new and unpredictable ways. Planet X was going to do...something...and I was either going to die in a planet-ending catastrophe or I was going to emerge as a survivor in the next chapter of humanity. Compared to working in a cubicle for like 40 years *both* of those options seemed pretty fucking cool because either choice had me essentially taking part in something that mattered on a global scale. It made me *feel something* as opposed to the absolute *nothing* of working in an office for the rest of my life. \n\nI'm not sure when I stopped believing it. I think it was a gradual thing. But now several years later I can definitely see why Q, flat earth, and all these other conspiracy theories are so tempting for most people. If you live in the middle of nowhere, can't travel, can't find work elsewhere, and are basically stuck somewhere for the rest of your life, there's a **huge** appeal for the possibility of *everything changing* because the only other alternative is everything staying the same.",

They've been trying to cultivate ties not just with Russia as well as Brazil and South Africa (the BRICS nations) as a way to create an alternative system to the west's dominance. If Russia is weak there is also the threat that the US will pivot from Europe and devote more attention to Asia which China doesn't want.\n\n> China is on the verge of lending aid to Russia\n\nChina is considering sending aid to Russia but they haven't done so yet and I think it's more likely than not that they will not do so. China doesn't want a weak Russia but they also don't really have a vested interest in Eastern Europe. Sending aid to Russia would likely result in sanctions and heavily increased tensions and even if Russia were to \"win\" in Ukraine it's not like China would really benefit much. They may consider it as a way to test western resolve and potentially test out some of their new weapons and there is a good chance Russia is offering some absolutely crazy good deals in exchange for weapons.

    "content": "It‚Äôs a delicate balance.\n\nFirst things first, context. China is the ‚Äúworkshop of the world‚Äù. It has a very large industrial capacity and a lot of industrial infrastructure. This has provided China the opportunity to grow and prosper by manufacturing goods for the rest of the world. This is a result of Globalization. China has a symbiotic relationship with the West. They simultaneously are in competition and in cooperation with the West.\n\nThat‚Äôs recent history. Long term history China has a lot of enemies. Consider Japan. Japan committed one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century against China, The Rape of Nanking. Japan, is also‚Ä¶ an American ally. Then you have South Korea as well pairing up with the US and you can see how China might develop a distrust of American power.\n\nSo that‚Äôs context. Why would China want Russia weak and Russia to win in Ukraine?\n\nChina wants to curb American power. American power comes in two forms for China. Military Power, this includes NATO and Soft Power, which includes American Allies and ideologically aligned nations (Japan, South Korea are good examples here).\n\nWhat China needs is for the US to overcommit. While everyone is giving up stockpiles of arms to Ukraine, those nations still might need to replace those stockpiles. Rarely does equipment just sit for the sake of sitting. Stockpiles are part of strategic planning and so ‚Äúspending‚Äù your stockpile in Ukraine does, to some degree, limit your ability to strategically respond to something unforeseeable.\n\nSo, that‚Äôs the overcommitment on resources. China needs the US to exhaust political capital in trying to defeat Russia. This can be done by helping Russians win. If Russia starts winning it could create infighting among NATO members about who is ‚Äúpulling their weight‚Äù in terms of Ukrainian support. Then there‚Äôs local domestic support in each member country‚Äôs population. Many nations have handed over piles of cash and weapons to Ukraine and in some places, the local populations have made immense sacrifices to help with the war and sanctions. Germany is the most obvious example here. They gave up a lot of energy security, that their population is feeling the strain, to support Ukraine. Slowly grinding down peoples‚Äô patience is another goal.\n\nChina needs NATO to be embarrassed. Because if Ukraine loses. If Russia breaks through. It will absolutely have NATO in disarray. There will be some internal discussion around how to deal with this new paradigm shift that Russia is trying to create.\n\nChina needs this shift to happen. It has claims in the South China Sea and they want Taiwan. So, if allies are exhausted and political will at home is exhausted and NATO is embarrassed and stockpiles are thin‚Ä¶ this potentially creates the conditions for China to retake Taiwan.\n\nSo propping up Russia is necessary. They don‚Äôt want an equal partner in Russia but they want a partner in Russia. Remember, Russia invades neighbors and China is a neighbor to Russia. While on some level unthinkable, anything is possible with Putin. Ukraine was considered unthinkable too.\n\nBut the goal is to essentially embarrass the West and get Western populations to have a distaste for supporting foreign nations and allies so that China can press its regional power and unify with Taiwan.",

When that happens, large parts of the country could rapidly de-industrialize and revert to something that looks closer to 1823 than 2023.\n\nChina's economy is propped up by foreign currency and cheap manufacturing. A general conflict with the West would bring that screaming to a halt, and some of that manufacturing is already moving elsewhere.\n\nChina, despite it's size, is remarkably resource poor, primarily in arable land to grow food, and oil. Kind of hard to run a superpower when you don't have food or oil, so they import a ton of the stuff.\n\nRussia does nothing to solve problem 1 - that's what ultimately sinks China as we know it today. Russia does a little to alleviate problem 2 - arms sales are easy, high value cash, and China is still imitative rather than innovative when it comes to military systems. However, problem 3 is one Russia can help solve, in part. Russian oil that used to flow to Europe can now be sent to China, making the Chinese less dependent on the rest of the world for oil.\n\nOn top of that, Russia-Ukraine is a petri dish for a possible China-Taiwan conflict. If the West had backed down, China might very well have invaded Taiwan. However, given the unified global response and Russia's lack of success, China will now have to think twice about a large scale invasion of a technologically sophisticated island nation. The Russians had to cross land and the Chinese will have to cross water - it's easy to drive a tank over land, but getting it over water is much harder.",

This concept goes back to Richelieu's concept of the balance of power effort in Europe, which was practiced artfully by him to protect France from being consumed by the Holy Roman Empire, then by Metternicht to sustain influence for the dying power of Austria throughout the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Then once again by Bismarck who managed to unite Germany for the first time while facing enemies in all sides. \n\nThe concept simply put requires that any power that gains hegemony does so to the demise of all other powers. The Holy Roman Empire would have consumed and destroyed France had Richeliu not sought to balance its power through funding the armies of other powers, such as the King of Sweden. As the saying goes, \"The enemy of my enemy is my ally.\"\n\nChina does not want a strong Russia because a strong Russia can exert massive influence over Asia and Africa. Further, a strong Russia will be a major threat (as it has been) to China. At the same time, China doesn't want a weak Russia because a weak Russia would fail to balance the powers of the United States and Europe. China wants a Russia that's just strong enough to act as a bulwark but not strong enough that China cannot exert influence over it. China needs Russia in this goldilocks zone in order to strengthen its own position.",

    "content": "This is China's most ideal situation.\n\nFirst thing is first, China and Russia are NOT allies. They are currently cooperative out of necessity, but outside their shared opposition to the US, they are adversaries to each other. They're currently working together because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. \n\nChina views Russia as the biggest culprit in their century of humiliation narrative. Russia forced China to concede a huge part of its territory after the Chinese lost a war. That huge chunk of land is now Russia's most important area in the east because it grants Russia access to the Pacific, denies China access to the sea of Japan, and it includes the key city of Vladivostok. China wants all that land back plus some more because China has massive population, a very large and consuming economy, and not enough resources to keep sustain the growth. Siberia has exactly what they need and they set up the nationalist narrative to justify taking it back. \n\nChina doesn't like how Russia is trying to regain its influence in the former Soviet states. This is why China has spent the past couple of decades trying to make ex Soviet states as dependent on them as possible by exploiting their hatred of Russia. China sees increased Russian influence as lost Chinese influence. In some cases, Russian influence could directly threaten China. For example, China has built a trade corridor in central Asia, and most of China's natural gas imports come from there, but the region is very unstable. It's unstable because of Russian meddling, it continues to be unstable because of Russian meddling, and things could get worse because of Russian meddling. If a war breaks out in the region, Russia will be the biggest winner and China will be the biggest loser. This is because on top of losing their energy imports, they also have even more instability on the doorstep of their already unstable Xinjiang province.\n\nBUT despite all of this, China has an even bigger enemy to worry about. China's coast is surrounded by US allies like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. The US also has secondary allies in the region like Vietnam, Thailand, and India who all have interest in keeping China in check. What this means is that China cannot secure sea access in or out of it's coast. This is a huge problem because most of their economy is dependent on exporting manufactured goods and the importing vital resources like energy and food. If the US or any of these countries decide to close any of the gaps between, the islands, China's economy is screwed. But it's even worse for them because they can't attack a country because there's no way the Chinese military, and especially the Chinese navy, could stand against its American counterparts. Not only that but America's allies are all powerful and could easily track, slow down, or even stop China's advances. This is on top of the US supporting Taiwan, countering Chinese influence on globally, and criticizing China's human rights record. China needs a partners to counter the US.\n\nHowever, there aren't that many countries that are completely opposed to the US and support the Chinese at the same time, and so the list China has is very short. It gets even shorter when China looks for a partner with global influence. China doesn't really have any other option other than Russia, and so they teamed up because they don't have other good options. This worked fine for awhile, but Putin made the dumbest decision of his life by sniffing his propaganda farts and invading all of Ukraine. Russia is no longer a global power in any sense, and it's getting destroyed in Ukraine. However, if Russia lost then the West will get even more influential and China will be even more outnumbered, the CCP can't have this. China also can't seize the opportunity and invade Siberia to take their lost lands (yet) because Putin is desperate and could use nukes and the invasion would give the west a golden opportunity to end the war in Ukraine and fight the Chinese indirectly. The West could promise to supply Russia with weapons if it promises to leave Ukraine and pay war reparations, that's a deal they can't refuse. China can't have that either. So the best alternative is to have indebted Russia that still stands but gives China what it wants.\n\nThat's where we are now. China can milk more and more concessions from Russia in exchange for more weapons. From draining lake Baikal to allowing Chinese companies to extract resources from Siberia to having Russia fall in line with Chinese foreign policy to testing its weapons in a live war. Russia will allow China to get everything they want short of annexing parts Siberia. This allows China to firmly turn Russia into a junior partner state where they get to reap most the benefits and have the final say while at the same time providing very little in return. This is the best thing that could happen to China. \n\nThe only caveat is that China has to keep their true intentions and action on the down low to not piss off the West and trigger a reaction from them. If China gets sanctioned by the West like Russia, then China would collapse in a few months. Say what you will about Russia's economy. It's tiny, it's inefficient, it's a gas station, whatever, but Russia's economy is largely self-sufficient, China's economy is the exact opposite. That level of sanctions on China would be the end of the CCP. So in the future be on the watch out for China speaking out both sides of their mouth. Helping and reassuring Russia with weapons and propaganda while at the same time trying to convince the West that they're actually against the invasion and they're really just neutral.",

Australia is becoming increasingly subsumed into Chinese economic hegemony.\n\nAnd exactly what kind of things could the US give to countries in APAC and SEA short of outright security guarantees, which will only further enflame tensions with Beijing?\n\nI agree Chinese influence needs to start being curbed, but this is going to be a pretty monumental task for US diplomats.",

    "content": "Nuclear reactors take too long to build, they are magnitudes more expensive, and are a logistical nightmare. Also, you are very wrong about taking less space and producing more power.\n\nA nuclear reactor produces about 1GW of electricity. However, for safety purposes, a nuclear reactor requires an exclusion zone. The size of the exclusion zone for a nuclear power plant varies depending on the design of the plant, the potential hazards associated with it, and the regulations of the country where it is located.\n\nI am not sure about France, or where to find this information, but let's use the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommendations for the US, because it is likely the same or similar. the NRC recommends a 16km¬≤ exclusion zone. This is far more space than what is necessary to produce 1GW of just solar energy. Let us do a little math.\n\nThe amount of space required to generate 1GW of power from solar panels depends on several factors, including the efficiency of the solar panels, the amount of sunlight that the panels receive, and the system design.\n\nAssuming an average solar panel efficiency of 20% and an average solar irradiance of 1,000W/m¬≤, we can estimate the amount of space needed to generate 1GW of power from solar panels.\n\nPower = area x efficiency x irradiance \n\n1GW = area x 0.20 x 1,000W/m¬≤ \n\nArea = 1GW / (0.20 x 1,000W/m¬≤) \n\nArea = 5,000,000m¬≤ or 5km¬≤\n\nTherefore, approximately 5km¬≤ of solar panels would be required to generate 1GW of power.\n\nOf course, if we tripled the area to 15km¬≤ to compensate for power fluctuations due to the local weather and environmental conditions, we would absolutely generate more power than a nuclear reactor on average and in optimal conditions, far more power.\n\nHowever, the reality is that solar panels can be distributed granularly within residential areas, so we don't even need to block off a large area. We can place them on top of buildings, over parking lots, on tall poles, on overpasses, etc. So realistically, if the system is designed properly, we wouldn't need to have sectioned off area at all for solar panels. This doesn't even include things like wind power generation, hydro electric dams, geothermal electric production, tidal turbines, etc.\n\nHonestly, there is zero reason to use nuclear power, it is a finite resource, costly, logistically difficult, and in case of a war or conflict, a dangerous vulnerability. In every situation, it is better to invest in renewable energy than building a new nuclear power plant.",

    "content": "You make interesting claims, however, renewable energy relies on factors we can't directly control, like how much wind is going to blow, or how much the sun is going to shine.\n\nConsidering world biodiversity has fallen by about 70%, turning green fields into unproductive areas where solar panels can be placed to collect energy would be wasteful. Such an endeavor would work, say, in some desert, where there are no green fields, but this would not make sense for reasons that there are no deserts nor does the sun shine as bright, say, in northern France, or the rest of northern Europe, or the UK, or Canada, or Russia, or China, or most of the northern hemisphere... You get my drift I think\n\nLet's do a fun comparison. The Shotwick Solar Park in the UK, compared to the Torness Nuclear Power Station. They both take up about equal landmass (the solar farm takes up about 220 acres, and the nuclear plant takes up 184 acres). However, the power plant makes 6679 GWh every year; the solar farm makes... 68.59 GWh every year. That is **97.4 times less** energy than the powerplant makes in a single year, for the same amount of land. For the solar farm to make as much energy as the powerplant does, it would have to expand by a little over 21200 acres. That is land that could be used for farming or turned into a forest.\n\nAs I said, in warmer parts (like a desert) of the world solar is better than here, but then again Europe doesn't have deserts. Even in deserts, however, solar, when placed under equal amounts of land compared to nuclear, cannot produce the same amount of energy. However, at least there is space there.\n\nFor a continent like Europe, marketing solar panels as eco-friendly because you can place them above car parks or on top of suburban homes is a joke, because both car culture and low-density housing are **extraordinarily bad for the environment**. You'd be taking up space that could be returned to mother nature. Why cover it in concrete and asphalt? \n\n**Putting solar panels on top of such infrastructure, my friend, is the epitome of greenwashing.**\n\nI think **we should invest in better renewables**, as the current ones just aren't cutting it. For the time being, however, nuclear is our best bet - even though it's far from perfect, and has its potential major risks, yes; but it is far better than coal or renewables in their current abilities. The ideal would be if we could harness all the power of lightning strikes and power the entire world for free, with zero emissions, but we just don't live in that world.",

No one believed us, but in 2014 Russia went and took part of the Ukraine with exact words and latest is 2022. All Russia wants is to take back those countries and make their lives miserable.

If they do not like responsibilities, they do not care.\n\n2. We can't stand against Russia on our own and making partners in west is very beneficial.

Funny enough, they are basically the same. Reason was \"the other side\", not that you were demanding land from sovereign states or threating to attack them, should they fail to accept. \n\nI have huge respect on JBP in many things, but this is simply appalling. People are *de facto* being massacred due Putins warmongering and someone has nerves to put the blame on other side. This goes against everything he has taught or spoke during last couple years.\n\nAnyone who thinks blame is one west, I strongly recommend to read \"Gulag\" and then come live to eastern parts of Europe and then answer this: Would you submit to genocide? Because that is what russkies are doing and that is what they will do if we don't start providing proper weaponry and isolate russkies wherever we can. \n\nAnd you can stick your whataboutims to where sun doesn't shine.",

They have a unified currency but lack the institutions to set or enforce bloc-wide fiscal policy, so economic autonomy seems unlikely, especially on the union's flanks.\n\nFrance has championed the cause of a continental military for decades but has always been seen as being the nation most likely to benefit from a defense appropriation and influence perspective. In the 90s the Germans were unable to field a military with projection capabilities and the UK would never submit to a non-UK European command structure, so France would command all European military power as the largest contributor while the UK's research-and-development and technology sharing agreements with the US removed major UK defense contractors from European defense collaborations. It's unclear how the EU goes about building a formidable super-national military organization when nationalism typically plays major component of military service. NATO has been a good blueprint with nations contributing functional groups for the purpose of working alongside other nation's units as combined arms brigade, but the constituent arms are national armies first and NATO command second.\n\nPolitically, the EU is more diverse than ever with various overlapping cultural and political issues not unlike the US across regions and state-to-state, but Americans are still united by their identification as American first and anything else second. For all the talk of extreme polarization, America political conflict is derived from groups refusing to surrender their right to direct national action - it's a product of deep personal, political engagement. There is a similar trend that's been happening in Europe for generations where citizens are more likely to see themselves as Europeans foremost, but hard times drive populist and nationalist wedges and the EU has been slow and weak to confront and counteract the view that the EU is still controlled by and supports Western Europe. The disdain for Germany in the midst of the numerous economic crises that hit the bloc show the need for stronger economic reform and the long journey ahead to embrace the nations left behind by institutional educational and industrial development.\n\nThey fix a lot of problems by finding a way to regather the wandering British without disrespecting their sometimes-valid critiques of the Union, reform their economic union to control fiscal policy in the support of employment, and de-centralize their significant Western industrial and financial bases while increasing support for NATO operations and development on the continent. All very difficult things to do while their traditional power base flirt with nationalist leaders and the Hungarians are out to lunch.",

    "content": "China stopped being the primary source of cheap labour a decade ago. Their wages rose enough to make Chinese production single-digit percentage cheaper than western production. They excel at two things, mid-level assembly (things like cars, phones, and other gadgetry) and scale (large equipment, massive steel works, refined petrochemicals). Neither of which can be reliably outsourced to undeveloped nations, as proven by the fact China has outsourced so much of its own production to even poorer nations and acts as a middleman for western companies to hide the fact they use labour from places that make Chinese mega-factories with suicide netting and escape fences look good.\n\nWith the recent chip sanctions, and the 2025 domestic production plan burning to the ground, China is already in a difficult spot with the former. Importing high grade chips is now practically impossible, importing the resources for manufacturing semiconductors is also heavily regulated and effectively chokes the option of importing a domestic manufacturing base, and exporting Chinese chips to most western nations is also prohibited to kill demand and disincentive domestic investment. As time progresses and chips become more integral to more production lines, as they have for the last few decades, entire industries are going to have to move out of China to escape the sanctions.\n\nAnd on mass scale China is slowly going to come into competition within India and Africa, which is why their Belt and Road initiative is trying to create a financial empire with predatory debt traps and mandatory investment schemes. To them, the future of scale lies in owning the global supply of resources, and gaining trade dominance for the third world. Effectively replacing the long lost cheap domestic labour with a monopoly on cheap foreign labour.\n\nPeople don't realize just how fucked China already is over the next couple of decades without significant change. They've exhausted their growth and reached the stage of entering post-industrial economics without the infrastructure, societal progress, diplomatic and political connections, or basic economic plan needed to survive the transition. Already their fake-construction GDP production scheme has started to slip, and banks have been purged following runs that were only stopped by direct government interventions. They're nowhere near collapse yet, but decline becomes inevitable long before it becomes crashing and China understands their position well. That's why their current military buildup plan ends in 2030 and all speculation is that they're on the final stages of planning a paradigm shift to maintain status before unavoidable full collapse can threaten them",

    "content": "**From Evan Feigenbaum and Adam Szubin:** When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, China‚Äôs leaders attempted to balance two fundamentally irreconcilable interests. First, they aimed to bolster China‚Äôs entente with Russia to counterbalance American power and alleviate growing strategic pressure from the West. Second, although they backed Moscow, they sought to avoid unilateral and coordinated sanctions aimed at China‚Äôs government, companies, and financial institutions.\n\nFor a year, China has been performing the ‚ÄúBeijing straddle,‚Äù tacking uncomfortably between these competing objectives under the white-hot light of international scrutiny. China has generally refused to sell arms to Russia and to circumvent sanctions on Moscow‚Äôs behalf because preserving global market access is more important to Beijing than any economic link to Russia. Simply put, China has no interest in being Russia‚Äôs proxy. But Beijing has also tried to have its cake and eat it, too, by endorsing Russia‚Äôs rationales for the conflict, coordinating with Moscow diplomatically while it cautiously abstains in United Nations votes, taking full advantage of discounted Russian oil, and enhancing economic linkages to Russia that do not violate Western sanctions. Indeed, China-Russia trade rose by a staggering 34.3 percent in 2022 to a record $190 billion.\n\nBeijing has also learned important lessons even as it struggles to maintain this balance. Specifically, it has closely studied the Western-led sanctions campaign. And it knows that, if tensions with the West continue to intensify, these same economic weapons may well be turned against China. Over the last 20 years, China‚Äôs leaders have watched as Washington honed and more frequently deployed economic weaponry, including sanctions, export controls, investment restrictions, and tariffs. But the major Western sanctions campaigns have generally not applied to China because they targeted second-tier economies, such as Iran and Iraq, or more often, marginal economies such as Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan. The current Ukraine conflict has, at long last, given Beijing an opportunity to study the strategy, tactics, and capabilities of a Western sanctions coalition as it works to cripple one of the world‚Äôs largest economies.  \n\nOf course, in some ways, it is too soon for Beijing to draw the full range of lessons from the Western sanctions effort against Russia. The sanctions include both measures that have instant effect, such as asset freezes, and those that are designed to bite ever more deeply in the years to come. Among the latter are export controls on computer chips and advanced technologies and restrictions on helping Russia develop the deep-water, Arctic, and shale resources on which its future energy revenues depend. But China has already absorbed certain key lessons, some of which are sobering. Perhaps the most important has nothing to do with payment systems or oil tankers but is rather about the power of international partnerships.",

You're more than welcome to decide who YOU trade with... because of sovereignty.\n\n\n------------\n\nNote how all the votes he mentioned where china condemned sanctions were when the US was imposing global unilateral coercive measures (which by the way it is now using in its war against china itself on some pretty egregious ways)",

    "content": "Interesting article.\n\nFrom the Chinese perspective, I think they learned that NATO wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äútoothless‚Äù organization. For a lot of Russias earlier wars NATO had half response or disunity. But when the Russians finally pulled the trigger on Ukraine NATO had a unified, direct response.\n\nThe lessons China has learned is that NATO will respond and NATO and her populations are will to endure hardship for the war. Thinking here of Germany and essentially putting their economy at risk by replacing Russian gas imports.\n\nAlso, outside of actual boots on the ground‚Ä¶ the material support has been massive. It has made the difference.\n\nI hope China, or more specifically, President Xi learns that surrounding yourself with ‚Äúyes‚Äù men will lead to a deeply corrosive kleptocracy, as we‚Äôre seeing in Russia‚Äôs army. No fuel, no food and equipment. All a result of people stealing from the top down and no one reporting it because Putin doesn‚Äôt tolerate bad news.\n\nThe last lesson is China definitely needs to be more self sustaining. Once war breaks over Taiwan, sanctions will attempt to suffocate the Chinese economy. China should absolutely build an ‚Äúextended‚Äù economic network in both South America and Africa. These continents have ben brutalized by the West so the idea of forming an anti-West economic block makes perfect sense. China‚Äôs key surviving any economic sanctions from the West are in Africa. One of the most resource rich continents on the planet and the history of Western Colonial brutality is really where the conversation should start.\n\nThere are opportunities for China to decouple, to some degree from the West but Xi really needs to stop surrounding himself with sycophants and Yes Men and start leaning on China‚Äôs old way of leadership that lead them to this point.",

Russia is doing its best to create a parallel system of the \"pariah\" countries to entice nations with irredentist/expansionist claims into acting. Russia and Iran are going all in in trade and logistical integration with each other, North Korea will also join. While these countries themselves aren't economic powerhouses they make it easier for nations to pull the trigger knowing there is a fallback to prevent total economic collapse. At the very least, neutral countries will be able to trade/swap goods outside the purview of Western institutions. \n\nIf China knows it can find enough market to export to with and secure vast energy/agriculture imports overland/North Sea Route through Russia.. why wouldn't they act against Taiwan? I think about how 90%+ of high end chips are fabricated in Taiwan and the West is cracking down on their export to China. If this becomes more zero-sum China will be incentivized to cripple this to slow the increasing technological disparity between itself and the West.",

Russia should be encouraged to participate in U.N. proceedings as an active member, but they can be criticized and marginalized by the protesting actions of fellow Charter members. Russia should absolutely be removed (or suspended) from the U.N security council and reduced to a censured member status. That said, Lavrov, Putin, and all of Putin's cronies in his regime (and others) should swing in the Hague when this war ends; after their trial exposes them to the world for who they are and what they've done. This is how precedent is set for later relevance. I know a lot of people say they should be removed from the U.N. altogether, but then what? Wars are fought on the battlefield but end in diplomacy with an agreement. Sometimes, the agreement is totally lopsided in favor of the victor, but hostilities must eventually come to an end. If you give Russia nowhere to go for a diplomatic end, then *\"nowhere\"* is exactly where things will end up and the war will unnecessarily be fought until its bitter conclusion. Keeping them in the U.N. gives them a place to sit at the table where their eventual surrender can formally take place.",

I would like to touch on a point that no one in this thread has really mentioned and that is the media. \n\nI currently reside in Canada, so I'm primarily exposed to a lot of pro western media that obviously pushes for constant support for Ukraine. T.V, Radio, YouTube, Social Media, even the websites where I \"legally\" stream UFC/Boxing fights are peppered with ads about Ukraine. It even spills into conversations with my friends (in Canada), but compared to when I watch Mexican media it is non existent. Last year when I went back home to visit I even completely forgot about it until I read my /r/all feed.\n\nWhy the disparity in the media? I believe that there are 2 reasons for that.\n\n1. There isn't a motive to push the war effort in Mexico, we are not in NATO, we are not world leaders in weapons manufacturing. Manufacturing consent for the population on this matter is not as important as a place like Germany, UK, Canada, etc. \n2.

Now Kirill is Putins propaganda tool while Bartholomew is strongly condeming the war, removing Russians even further from international communities.\n\nPope Francis is smart enough to not go down the same path and risk creating a schism in his own church. Countries like Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Cuba have very substantial Catholic communities. Their governments don't support Ukraine, some even support Russia. The pope condemning Russia outright would only hurt the Catholic church and have no impact on the war.\n\nI strongly support secularism and I don't like him commenting on geopolitics, but Pope Francis probably has to say something about who's to blame for the war, so this non-answer is perfect.",

American forces call in air support and proceed to drop the hammer on those PMCs with B-52s, F-22s, attack helicopters, and an AC-130 gunship.

The Allies hoping that the Reds would lose the Russian Civil War and, as a result, allowing Russia essentially no part in the Versailles Peace Conference. This was in spite of the fact that Russia had been an enthusiastic member of the Entente and suffered a total of \\~1.8 to 2 million deaths in the conflict, and had only signed away modern-day Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russian Poland to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in a desperate bid to get out before the entire country collapsed wholesale. In essence, the Allies \"honored\" Brest-Litovsk, and instead of returning those forfeited territories to Russia (whose sacrifices for their cause should have at least been acknowledged, Soviet insurgency or no), chose to go nation-building in eastern Europe. This set the stage for WW2 - giving both Germany and Russia legitimate (however cynical and greedy they were) claims to go carving up former holdings that each side felt were \"rightfully\" theirs. Even though the USSR held these same countries following the second war, once the union imploded, they all flittered away, essentially leaving Russia in the same position as in 1919. It was like they had 'lost' WWI all over again.\n2. Putin and other like-minded Russians a) believing that the west is still conspiring against them (not going to comment on whether or not this is true or conspiratorial, though it feels like western aid to Ukraine has kind of made it a self-fulfilling prophecy), and b) eagerly wanting to reclaim the strength - if not, perhaps, the same exact character - of the former Soviet Union. The USSR was a 'big fish' - Putin & co. want to be a big fish again. That desire is ironically less about gobbling up territory than it is about being able to intimidate your perceived enemies. The Ukranian invasion was almost certainly mostly intended to accomplish the latter (even if it fell entirely on its face) - to 'scare' NATO with \"Russian might.\"",

    "content": "The real expos√© about the war is the level of propaganda western citizens face that blinds them to reality and how successful it is in mesmerising populations. In reality, the war you see in Ukraine is because of the US expansionism into Russias backyard, as a result of its vast military budget that allows it to overstretch itself militarily so far beyond its borders to the point it is perceived as a threat to nuclear superpowers like Russia on the other side of the planet.\n\nFor 30 years, Russia pleaded with the US to stop NATO expansion, based on a verbal agreement the US made to Russia which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, where the US agreed not to move \"one inch\" east from West Germany.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ricwe123/status/1619761304427970561\n\n The US violated this almost immediately, ignoring Russias legitimate security concerns, even though dozens of top US officials knew for a fact that Russia could feel forced to intervene militarily (even though it didnt want to) in order to stop an emerging threat to its territory. Current CIA director Burns is one of those people who noted this way back in 2008.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW265_a.html\n\n> NATO enlargement, particularly to Ukraine, remains \"an emotional and neuralgic\" issue for Russia, but strategic policy considerations also underlie strong opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia.  In Ukraine, these include fears that the issue could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even, some claim, civil war, which **would force Russia to decide whether to intervene**.\n\n In 2014, the US helped instigate and fund a coup in Ukraine to overthrow a democratically elected govt and install an anti-Russian govt that started banning the Russian language and carrying out various anti-Russian policies, which upset the Russian ethnic group living in East Ukraine. This in turn led to civil unrest there, which turned to civil war (as CIA Director Burns predicted back in 2008), which claimed the lives of over 13K ethnic Russian civilians, according to the UN. Even though there was plenty of domestic pressure to intervene to protect Russian civilians in the Donbass, the Russian govt once again tried to avoid getting into full blown conflict with Ukraine over this new crisis, and signed the Minsk Agreements with Ukraine (EU countries like Germany and France were guarantors), hoping this would ease tensions by allowing some autonomy within the eastern regions in Ukraine that wanted independence. The Agreement was violated continually, and far right elements in Ukraine ignored Zelenskys pleas to implement the agreement and then threatened to kill him if he didnt back down. There is a video of Zelensky at the front line back in 2019 where he asks the soldiers to pull back in accordance with Minsk, and they laugh in his face. Here is a Kyiv Post article about the whole affair, including the veiled threats to his life should he continue trying to implement this policy of de-escalation with Russia.\n\nhttps://www.kyivpost.com/post/6652\n\nYou have to keep in mind, Zelensky was elected on the pledge to end the war and solve issues with Russia. One of the reasons he got such a high percentage of the vote in Ukraine is because the Ukrainian civilians of Russian heritage (largely based in the East) voted for him due to his pledge to improve relations with Russia. The far right militias in Ukraine (based largely in the West) sabotaged his efforts from the get go.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MyLordBebo/status/1624870213572341764\n\nHere is another video of Zelensky stating his affection for Russia, its people, culture etc. He states that Ukrainian and Russians are fraternal peoples....even going as far as saying they are one people.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/e_l_g_c_a/status/1629912404581556225\n\nUnfortunately, At the end of the day, Zelensky backed down to the threats and pressure. The far right militias won and felt empowered that they could stand up to the President of the country, violate his direct orders to his face, threaten his life, and not even receive a slap on the wrist by the Ukrainian govt. It really highlighted how much power that they had amassed over the years since the 2014 coup. Even though they were not officially elected into parliament, the far right had influence through its military might, and the connections to the absurdly wealthy Ukrainian oligarchs who funded them, including Igor Kolomoisky, a prominent media magnate who was close friends with Zelensky...and even broadcast the show that propelled him to political power (\"Servant of the People\").\n\nThe rest is history. With the Minsk Accords being violated, the situation in the East continued to deteriorate. The US continued supplying Ukraine with more and more weapons and training, making Russia even more nervous about the prospects of the near future. They made one more attempt at diplomacy with the US at the start of 2022, asking that the US guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO. The Biden Administration responded that this request was a \"non-starter\". In other words, the US would not even entertain the thought of not doing it. No effort to diplomatically settle the crisis was ever on the cards for the US. Russia had exhausted all diplomatic avenues to settle this without full scale war, and finally decided it was now or never. A year later, hundreds of thousands dead, and a nation in ruins, with no end to the death and carnage in sight.\n\nThe US govt is overjoyed at this turn of events, and is in no hurry for peace (note that the US has not spearheaded any peace efforts or diplomacy, but has focused solely on funding the war via 100 billion in weaponry to Ukraine) and seems to want to replicate this carnage with Taiwan/China and needs a trillion dollar annual military budget to do so. Meanwhile, smug \"anti-war\" liberals in the US cheer it on without realising the horrific ramifications of such provocative acts and delusionally think that the US needs a trillion dollar budget in order to stop wars and promote peace, Ignoring the fact that the US has been at constant war with one country or another their entire lives. To them, The US, a country that has been at constant war, is the great peace promoter with its over bloated trillion dollar budget. The fact 100s of millions of Americans believe this really lays bare just how powerful US propaganda is and how many Americans lack any critical thinking skills.\n\nWhile the American populous cheers their \"peace promoting\" trillion dollar military budget, living conditions in the US continue to deteriorate, wages continue to stagnate, poverty & homelessness etc continues to rise, infrastructure continues to crumble, crime in major cities becomes epidemic, misery continues to grow, the cost of living spirals out of control, and legitimate grievances with the status quo feeds extremists on both sides (mainly far right - as seen on January 6th....a taste of things to come).\n\nThe Global South sees this insanity, and obviously wants no part of it. Countries in South East Asia have recently stated they dont want to be used as a Proxy against China. They know the US wants them to be used as cannon fodder against China (the same way Ukrainians are cannon fodder against Russia) and are vocally against such measures.\n\nhttps://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230203-indonesia-tells-outsiders-not-to-use-asean-as-proxy\n\n> Indonesia told major powers not to use Southeast Asia as a \"proxy\" for their rivalries",

The U.S. even sent aid money to Russia during the 1990s. As constituent and other countries have built up in the ensuing years, the U.S. military has not been idling. We have far more stealth fighters and EW sophistication and surveillance fidelity than 20 years back. We have GPS-guided artillery and stand-off munitions and conventional high-altitude ABM that didn't exist back then when we were flinging mostly unguided rockets as TERCOM/INS was so expensive (thus why so few Tomahawks). Our economy has grown 40-50% in real terms (15% of that is simply more people) so our % spend on military need not necessarily grow.\n\nThere's a military reason we don't pump up ammunition during peacetime. During wartime it's the launchers that win. Dumb ammunition is easy to make, century old tech that can be set up in anyone's basement. Even Tomahawk missiles can be mass produced as needed - there's only one turbojet and guidance set per missile, the rest is bomb and fuel mass. Remember Germany made just as much ammo as we did in WWII. Problem was they couldn't keep up with the launchers.\n\nRegardless of year I tend to see mainstream reporters as a peanut gallery. They often don't understand physics or military doctrine. Then again, no one perfectly understands military doctrine as every conflict is different. But witness the Sun reporter basically arguing with Pentagon planners, pointing out the dwindling missile attacks. Know what else is dwindling right now? Russia's artillery strikes.

Ukraine-Russia war looks largely not modern, and Afghanistan is a joke to call a modern threat, but at least U.S. used modern munitions there.\n\nThe U.S. is plenty able to scale up as seen in Iraq/Syria/Afghanistan. [From this article](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2016/05/us-raiding-its-global-bomb-stockpiles-fight-isis/128646/) you can see we dropped >40,000 smart bombs in a 1.5 year span 2014-16 (vs. ISIS), and U.S. arms makers simply increased production as the needs rose, whereas previously they were winding down due to expecting troop drawdown. In hindsight we never ran dangerously low or stalled in effectiveness.\n\nThe article also shows another reason why we don't stockpile enormous ammunition. They go obsolete. Cluster bombs became politically too thorny so overnight millions of rounds became tenuous to access. Obviously if the desperation arises, I expect we'll use those, even at the risk of killing some U.S. soldiers. (Btw, that means we can also access the same for Ukraine, just haven't.) Russia seems perfectly fine with cluster and old munitions causing substantial friendly fire, but we don't operate that doctrine in the U.S., which is why our casualties are more than an order of magnitude lower for the same type of operation.",

The war in Ukraine will shift geopolitics for decades to come:\n\nWe don't see it in the West because they don't want us to, but NATO has been humiliated far more than Russia during the past 12 months. NATO has accidentally broadcast to the world that they can't actually fight. That they have these great big ships and guns but in actual combat, they're useless because they can't produce the ammo necessary to use them for extended periods of time. Look at articles on Reuters or FT. Western leaders are begging Ukraine to go on an offensive because they know they can't supply them for another year. For the past 30 years, NATO combat has been oriented towards small scale mobile warfare. No NATO country has the industry to support extended warfare with a large country.\n\nLook at what NATO did in Iraq and Libya. Heavy air superiority so they can airstrike and do quick raids. They can't do that in Ukraine because Russia has good anti air (S300 and S400 are easily two of the best AA systems on the planet).\n\nAnother thing is that Russia is the first nation to face down Western sanctions and actually do fine. Russian exports are up because of India and China. Imports are fine because everything is made in China anyway. Countries like Saudi Arabia are now realising they're not as dependent on the USA as they once thought.\n\nBut this isn't the only thing. When Russia takes control of Eastern Ukraine (and it will, the West can't provide Ukraine with aid forever, Russia is shifting to a war time economy, if the West does this it's game over for them as they're already in a recession), it will control the world's fertiliser supply and a lot of arable land. Do you think they're going to export these things to their allies or their enemies? \n\nTL;DR: Russia is incompetent, but NATO has shown the world it is just as incompetent. It has also shown the world that it is completely dependent on other countries and can't do shit for itself. The reason we are focusing on Ukraine is so if this doesn't go the way NATO wants it to, the public will be more likely to support conscription so we can send our countrymen to die in a war in Eastern Europe.\n\nPeople can dismiss what I've said, I don't care if you live with your head in the sand, but eventually you will have to bring it out.",

Portraying Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria or any number of active conflicts is not supported because the nations most predominantly responsible for those conflicts ARE the western nations. In the case of Ukraine, it's comfortably forgotten that the 2014 governmental overthrow was done with the support from the western powers, because Russia did the more overt aggression by sending in troops. This makes them the \"bad guy\" in the eyes of western media and a good scapegoat to put all the current ills on. Trouble with food in shops? It's not Brexit, it's the conflict in Ukraine. Gas prices rising? Ukraine conflict. Need to moan at refugees? Ukraine conflict will help too!\n\nTo put a different way - there's nothing special about Ukraine in this case. Just that it is beneficial to support Ukraine in this politically. If we actually gave a shit about that country, a drive to send more weapons into a conflict zone would be seen as the kindling it is, rather than the pathway to peace it's presented as. There are ways to help struggling nations such as taking their refugees, offering them support and relocation, pushing for peace talks and compromises. Not an ever-going discussion of what bigger and newer weapons can be sent in. \n\nAlso, remember Iraq? Thousands of people were against it. People were against invading Syria and people didn't want to partake in military interventions during events of the Arab Spring. The people WANT to live in peace. It's largely irrelevant though, because here the media is mostly a censorship filled mouthpiece of the government and lately too many people are all too happy to take things at their word. Isn't just tied to wars. Things like Brexit also fit into this.",

By your own admission, this isn't even the first time they have used hypersonic missiles.\n\n\n>I believe it was a warning to NATO to not interfere directly. This warning may be to squelch the recent rumors of an impending NATO involvement.\n\n\nOne, the only rumours of nato involvement are coming from pro russians, and it's baseless. For a start you can't involve nato without agreement of all the members.\nSecondly how does firing a missile suppress rumours?\n\n\n>Russia is winning in Bakmuth, something that was popularly seen as Ukraine's last stand. \n\n\nThe only ones trying to make it out as ukraines last stand are russia. They want to act as if Bakhmuts fall will cause a collapse of the entire front. It's patently untrue. They have long Since built new defensive lines behind Bakhmut, which they will fall back to when it's no longer feasible to hold Bakhmut. Ukraine has also neglected to deploy their reserves into the front line, since they are holding them for their own offensive. Russia has meanwhile been constantly sending new troops to sustain the attacks. If this was Ukraines last stand, they wouldn't be holding their reserves, they'd be commiting them to the fight. Russia has tried to create a narrative where the loss of Bakhmut would be a huge strategic win for Russia. Ukraine evidently don't agree, as evident from their refusal to commit everything to it's defence. \n\n\n>I suppose they fear that NATO might want to get directly involved\n\n\nAgain, an impractical scenario. \n\n\n>Russia has used these missiles before, and my reading is these are clear warnings to NATO - \"don't push us there, these can just as well carry a nuke and reach anywhere in Europe, so back off. We have more of them than you think.\"\n\n\nIt doesent much change the balance of things. The reality is there are enough nukes in nato to overcome russian Defences. Especially as if they were going to launch nukes, they would almost certainly launch swarms of conventional missiles to either destroy or overwhelm existing russian air defence. \n\n\nNeither side is going to initiate nuclear warfare, because neither side will Remain standing in the aftermath of it. \n\n\n>Russia seeing this as an existential fight makes it bad for NATO because in Russian minds that makes going to any length justifiable.\n\n\nIt doesent really matter what the average russian wants, they aren't in control of their country.

The second point is the only one that could cause some raised eyebrows, but when you know that [China is not in any military alliances except one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_alliances_involving_China) and [they've consistently opposed military alliances](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/no-need-for-new-military-bloc-in-asia-pacific-china-tells-nato/2376968), it is entirely reasonable.\n\nAll the remaining points are mostly entirely reasonable and in fact high priorities, like protecting nuclear plants and POWs and starting peace talks. A peace plan shouldn't be some 2000 page bible no one can read. It should be a *short list of priorities everyone can agree on*. Literally the only two points that **official** US foreign policy, for our part, disagrees on are #2 and #10.\n\nI honestly suspect much of the hate for China is astroturfed. \"There has always been war in Eastasia.\" No thanks, CIA, I'm not cheering for a war between China and NATO/the West.",

I can't even imagine being in that kind of situation.\n\nRussians are well known for committing war crimes. World War II and the \"liberation\" of eastern Europe to Berlin an estimated 2.5 Million women were raped, gang raped and forced to abort their unwanted fetuses. 100,000+ committed suicide alone. The men were rounded up and shot infront of their own wives, sons and daughters while they were being assaulted in the streets. Women and girls ages 3-85 were assaulted. **Sick, sick motherfuckers.**\n\n50,000 people died in the Siege of Mariupol. I pray 500,000 Russian troops get fucked in return. Goddamn them all to hell.

I could see trying to intimidate us all, but if successful, that would only encourage more Western support for Ukraine.  \n\nThree: What the heck kind of tactical sense does it make to announce you‚Äôre making a move?  A big move especially, would be far easier to carry out if at least some of it can catch Ukraine off guard.  If the aim is to mislead Ukrainian forces into concentrating their efforts somewhere, maybe try announcing where that is.  As it stands, Ukraine may as well just keep focusing on crippling your forces as much as possible.",

I still think Russia is still on the losing side.\n\nFew things: \n\n1. Ukraine is fighting for their homeland, defending the buildings, children and land that their families have lived on. From a morale perspective, this is infinitely stronger than the Russians motivation, which are basically just ‚Äúfollow orders and get paid.‚Äù Imagine if your country was being invaded. \n\n2. Ukraine has the financial backing of almost half of Europe and the United States. Yes Ukraine will be bankrupt and massively in debt at the end of all this, but the rest of the world has invested in Ukraine. They will want to see Ukraine refortified and healthy so that they don‚Äôt have to do this all again. \n\n3. Ukraine has basically a near endless supply of weaponry. Russia‚Äôs stockpile is no slouch either, but Russia was banking on ‚Äúbleeding‚Äù Ukraine out. Now that the U.S (the most powerful military might on earth by a significant margin) and many other countries have committed to supplying Ukraine for the foreseeable future (at least till 2024 and probably longer), Russia will have to endure hundreds of thousands of more losses, if the current death rate holds. Who do you think is willing to sacrifice lives more, Russian infantry called up by a mandatory conscription order, or the fathers of Ukraine defending their home?\n\nWe don‚Äôt hear much about the domestic affairs of Russia that often, but don‚Äôt discount the growing collective frustration of the Russian people.

Putin should be expecting riots in 2024",

It could even bring the two states back to diplomacy. For this to occur, the Russian federation will have to incur massive casualties to realise that this abhorrent unprovoked invasion is not winnable. \n\nLuckily, the majority of western nations are countering Russia‚Äôs massive arms advantage with supplying Ukraine with modern military equipment such as the recently announced Leopard 2‚Äôs, M1‚Äôs and the supply of advanced air defences with the objective of levelling the playing field & hopefully grind the Russians out of Ukraine and back into their homeland. \n\nMake no mistake, both sides are taking a large amount of casualties. I believe it was stated (albeit a Ukrainian source) that the Russians have 180,000 killed or wounded while the Ukrainians have suffered roughly 100,000 KIA or wounded. You just have to keep in mind the goals of the two states in the war, the invaders are currently failing, while the Ukrainians are surviving, building their war machine and slowly grinding the Russians out.",

It's a proxy war at this point, but we've chosen the Ukrainian side. \n\nCheck your news sources carefully, and check the sources for those sources.  Right now, the major media in the USA is almost entirely pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia, and they have very few sources in Russia to know what is actually happening there.

From what I have read Russia has the artillery advantage and technically 'holds the airspace' but really its more of a no fly zone. Russia's economy has taken a large hit and popularity is not great. A lot of older equipment making up the bull of their mobile forces were lost during the early phases of the invasion. Poor logistics, bad intelligence and. They somehow thought the Ukrainian people would not resist. They took a massive blow from reservists and \"volunteers\" early in the conflict. For a larger and better equiped and richer nation this should have been an easy victory for Russia and they screwed it up bad. Russia does not have the supplies it needs to be really effective. Much of their equipment is old and rusty scrap with a few high tech things here and there.\n\nUkraine is suffering a deep economic blow and incredible inflation (last I read was 22%) their economy is total war and they are nearly maxed out on conscriptable men. Several cities have been flattenned and shells in their farmlands suggest they will need decades to rebuild what was lost. Ukraine, thanks to her supporters, enjoys state of the art equipment and other equipment of varied usefulness. Many of the modern equipment outperforms the Russian equipment by a large margin. Due to these deals Ukraine is well equiped with arms and non arm equipment and enjoys the homefield advantage. They have proven to be very effective. Sometimes Russia has sucessfully baited them to advance while feigning retreat causing huge casualties with artillery out in the open. Ukraine has sucessfully kept Russia from air auperiority and has retaken a fair ammount of lost territory. Ukrainian retraining with Nato gave them advantages and options the Russians did not consider as they assumed that they would be facing an ex soviet army like their own (and they kind of are in some ways)\n\nThis has become a war of attrition and Ukraine is taking the larger hit on their economy and population. Normally that could end things but allied support means their own economy isn't funding the conflict as much as the oomph they get out of it so they can fight longer and harder than that metric. The big problem will be manpower. Ukraine simply cannot keep replacing troops and Russia can suffer 20:1 or 30:1 (not real numbera but made up) and still keep fighting.\n\nSo it comes down to who gives up first. \"Wars end when the cost of fighting becomes greater than the cost of losing\"... Both sides ar eloosing badly... My guess tho would be that Russia has the upper hand as Ukraine has suffered all damage on home terf while Russia has lost little on home terf but huge losses on the offensive... Russia has gains while Ukraine is struggling to hold on.",

In the background, a Polish S-70i Black Hawk helicopter of the GROM military unit\n\nThe photo was taken at the turn of February/March last year, in the first weeks of the war. At the time, Ukrainian-Russian talks were held in Brest, Belarus, in an attempt to end the war.\nFlights of the Ukrainian delegation with Oleksiy Reznikov and Roman Abramovich to the negotiations took place from Biata Podlaska in Poland and were supervised by the Polish government\n\nPoland, thanks to the organization of the Special Forces, had access to first-hand information, and guaranteed the return of the Ukrainian delegation at a very uncertain time. Besides, the JWK had already cooperated with the Ukrainian Special Forces long before the war, training, among other things, elite infantry units\n\nJacek Kumoch also flew with the Ukrainian delegation and Roman Abramovich to the peace talks in Ankara in March 2022, where, thanks to his excellent fluency in Turkish (he was ambassador to Turkey), he had the closest access to emerging information on the situation on the frontlines\n\nIn addition, these talks resulted in exchanges of Russian prisoners of war for defenders of Azovstal, thanks to Roman Abramovich's contacts, desperately trying to remain in the West but not opposing Putin. On the flight to Ankara for the talks, Abramovich, as well as Ukrainian delegation, began to show symptoms of poisoning. It later emerged that the participants had been poisoned with an unknown substance in non-life-threatening quantities, a signal from the Russian services that the participants in the talks were in their sights\n\nRegardless of what anyone thinks of the peace talks with the Russians, the messenger has been a sacred person for thousands of years",

If you care about the rights of ordinary people to live freely and without heavy handed interference from the government, you should care about the war in Ukraine.

The US does about $1.1 trillion in business with Europe annually and a significant portion of that business would be at risk.\n\nFurthermore, certain countries, particularly Poland and Lithuania (and soon Finland and Sweden), would almost certainly request a permanent NATO military presence, which they have a right to as NATO members. And that military presence would probably consist largely of US personnel.\n\nAnd the two issues described above would also draw US resources away from Asia and the Middle-East, allowing other countries to gain new ground in those regions.

Russia can simply throw human lives and equipment at the wall until they have flattened every building in Ukraine, simply to say \"If we can't have this, nobody can.\" But this is costly to Russia who would surely prefer *not* to be doing this if they saw an alternative.

I think it's batshit fucking crazy to be in this alliance. I can't understand why Canada would want to be obligated to treat an attack on Estonia as an attack on ourselves, when we know that Estonia treating an attack on Canada as an attack on themselves means *nothing.* Mutual defense pacts should provide *mutual* defense.

It was taken by surprise by Russia‚Äôs February 2022 invasion of Ukraine despite the US warning everyone for nearly a whole year- many Chinese citizens living/workin/studying in Ukraine were killed by Russian forces in the first days of the invasion. \n\nThe latest example is the efforts by US officials to resolve the spy balloon with their Chinese counterparts before it became public, only to be met with unaware and confused responses by Chinese authorities- it was like nobody in the Chinese government was aware of what anyone else in the Chinese government was doing. It wasn‚Äôt until the spy balloon went public and the damage to their reputation began to be felt that the Chinese started to have some answers. \n\nThe most concerning thing is if you do manage to communicate effectively to the Chinese officials of the diplomatic corps the consequences of further military assistance to Russia, there is still the risk that the message will not reach the Chinese decision makers in their government- even if the consequences are dire enough to make them refrain from aiding Russia, they wouldn‚Äôt get the message until it was too late.",

    "content": "> Only a handful of tech companies that work with the Chinese military are sanctioned\n\nThe US government clsims that the sanctions target companies that work with the Chinese military, but if you look at the list of sanctioned companies, that just isn't the case.\n\nThe US has systematically expanded its sanctions to cover all the major players in China's chipmaking industry. The goal of the sanctions - which is openly stated by American officials and politicians - is to prevent China from developing any advanced chip industry.\n\nTo give you a concrete example, SMIC wasn't sanctioned because it works with the Chinese military. The US hasn't presented any evidence that SMIC does so. SMIC was sanctioned because it is China's most advanced chip fab. Without sanctioning SMIC, US sanctions against other Chinese tech companies (such as the sanctions against Huawei, which also have nothing to do with military activity) would be less effective, because those companies could buy advanced chips from SMIC. The logic of these sanctions is that the US expands them further and further to try to cut off every route that China has of getting around the last round of sanctions.\n\nThere is now talk in the US of expanding sanctions further, to cover biotech, AI, and many other tech fields. The intention is to cripple China's high-tech sectors.",

Then the rest of country went out he run from Ukraine to Russia.\nI see no involvement of USA in this. They didn't even wanted to join NATO but after threats from Russia this became real issue. Then Donbas after Putin realised that he won't get back Ukraine. \nIf you know shit about Eastern Europe politics I'd advise you to read first then make any assumptions, because saying USA is bad ergo they are responsible for this makes no sense. \n\n\nAlso I recently started to advise people to think just a little bit about one important thing. Why is that all former USSR and Warsaw pact countries don't want to have anything with Russia? And all of them rather choose to join EU and NATO instead of CSTO? \nInteresting isn't it?",

    "content": "The war in Ukraine has apparently entered a new, hot phase this week: according to the report, the expected Russian spring offensive has begun in the east of the country. The Russians are attacking on a broad front, but have apparently not yet managed to make any major gains in terrain. And if they do, then only with considerable losses.\n\nThe Western weapons that have been delivered in recent weeks and months are now all the more important for the defense. For example, the self-propelled howitzers, Gepard anti-aircraft tanks and Mars rocket launchers delivered from Germany. But now of all times, in the hot phase of the war, there are apparently new significant problems with the weapons, Business Insider learned from several high-ranking sources in the German government.\n\nGerman tank howitzers are jammed in front of the Ukrainian border\n\nAccordingly, Slovakia has not been allowing weapons from Ukraine into its country for weeks, which are supposed to be repaired there, they say. In mid-December, Kraus-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) set up a repair center near the Slovakian town of Michalovce on the border with Ukraine on behalf of the German armed forces to repair broken howitzers, Cheetahs and Mars systems.\n\n**But Slovakia does not allow the weapons to cross the border into the center, reportedly citing unresolved legal issues, including import duties.** According to insiders, transport vehicles with up to 15 broken self-propelled howitzers are waiting at the Slovakian border to continue their journey. The heavy artillery pieces on the Ukrainian side are extremely important for the defense.\n\nIn order to defuse the situation at least partially, the German Ministry of Defense is said to have transported individual weapons to the center via neighboring EU countries, which not only means a detour of hundreds of kilometers, but above all a considerable loss of time for repairs. Mars missile launchers and Gepard tanks are also to be partially repaired in Germany.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why Slovakia is reacting in this way despite an intergovernmental agreement to this effect. On the German side, it is admitted that some legal issues concerning the repair center were overlooked due to the speed with which the agreement was concluded at the end of last year. On the other hand, Slovakia is also facing new elections after the government was brought down by a vote of no confidence in December. Since then, there has been a government crisis and an unclear balance of power. The left-wing opposition is considered to be rather pro-Russian. \n\nAfter various interventions by the German government at different levels, Olaf Scholz (SPD) has now also intervened, according to information from Business Insider. Thus, the still caretaker Slovak government around Eduard Heger assured Chancellor Scholz in a telephone call last week that the problem would now be solved promptly. However, no one in the German government wants to rely on this at the moment.\r  \nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",

No. It is not a useful weapon there.\n\nexactly the opposite:\n\n>During World War I, the entrenching spade was also pressed into service as a¬†melee weapon.

Stabbings happen all the time. How often does the blade get stuck in the victim?\n\n The blade gets stuck between bones. In the rip cage for example. The military manuals of bayonets advised not to stab in the chest because of this or try to twist it inside the body to get it out. Also really common problem in sword fighting. \n\n>Four or six inches penetration is sufficient to incapacitate and allow for a quick withdrawal, whereas if a bayonet is driven home too far, it is often impossible to withdraw it. In such cases, a round should be fired to break the obstruction.\n\n>A realistic effect, necessitating a strong withdrawal, as if gripped by a bone, is obtained by inserting pieces of hard wood, ¬º inch thick (pieces of crating or boxes), between the stuffing and the sack on the side facing the attacker, and the grain must be vertical.\n\n>the clean withdrawal of the bayonet‚Äîwhich requires no small effort, especially should it be fixed by the bone‚Äîare of the greatest importance, and need the same careful attention and constant practice as are devoted to obtaining efficiency with the rifle\n\n~Bayonet Training Manual Used by the British Forces\n\n1917\n\nEspecially the last paragraph shows that withdrawing the bayonet is nothing easy and that problems woth wothdrawing are real.",

Do you see the destruction of their country and the lives they are losing? Do you think Zelensky is hiding billions of dollars himself?\n\nWhat exactly are the allegations of misuse of the US aid? Half of the aid is in military equipment. Are you suggesting that people are stealing the equipment in large quantities and selling it? \n\nIn an extremely patriotic environment where people have adapted to risking their lives for the country?\n\nthis Ukraine Aid is the highest ROI USA has gotten from military spending in decades. and it's not even close. just take the win and don't obsess over perfection",

It‚Äôs anecdotal of course, but most Russians I‚Äôve interacted with in Russia both before and during the war offer nuanced takes on this. Some think Crimea should remain Russian, some think it should be returned. Some have been opposed to the annexation since the beginning, some came to oppose it later. Many just don‚Äôt know. My mother in law, for example, was born in Crimea but left in her childhood for Moscow where she‚Äôs been ever since. She isn‚Äôt sure what to think, although she is generally opposed to the war and believes that returning Crimea should be a part of a peace deal.\n\nIt is complicated, and no matter how black and white we‚Äôd like it to be, it just isn‚Äôt.",

Running the administrations of occupied zones too where we know brutal war crimes are happening. The kidnapping of children thing is a big part too. There's been about 15,000 of those. Has anyone part of that process leaked info to the world? It's easier than ever to do. Instead we find most people going along with it, civilian and soldier alike.\n\nThe line between civilian and military in total war situations blurs. It's an unfortunate reality. Factories are legitimate military targets for example, but the people there are almost always civilians not soldiers.\n\n>If you mean \"It's okay to stand by while innocent people are murdered\", then yes. We're doing it right now. We - us two - doing almost nothing to fight Russia at the moment.\n\nThey're not \"doing nothing\" their activities are supporting the war effort. No, not every single person. Some people are resisting and taking the risks therein. Most aren't though. Most aren't even reluctant about it either. Most are supportive and cheering it on despite hundreds of thousands of their countrymen needlessly becoming casualties.\n\n>In Russia?! How do you passively end the war?\n\nNot volunteering, not sharing propaganda, not blindly accepting the narrative, not signing up for overtime, not accepting your quality of life declining and friends and family dying for Putin's glory. Draft dodging is a thing you know and every war has had it to some degree or another. \n\nThing is most Russians *like* what Putin is pitching to them. They like the revanchist attitude, the idea of a world that will fear Russia. Even the ones who fled the country say they mostly did it for economic reasons not because they oppose the war or its war goals.\n\nCompare the Russian vs Belarussian societal response. They sabotaged railways (a key reason why the run on Kyiv stalled out), soldiers and officers (including senior ones) put in leave requests and made it impossible for Belarus to send forces to fight, and enough Belarussians have joined the UAF that whole battalions of them exist. Belarus is a repressive dictatorship that had a recent crackdown. There's extrajudicial killings, torture, kidnappings, and violent crackdowns for opposition. Guess what? The people *still resisted*. We see nothing of the sort or scale in Russia.\n\nOrganizing resistance is hard and has risks. That doesn't mean you don't have a moral obligation to support it when your government is committing atrocities. They're not as guilty as people like Putin for sure, but their hands aren't clean. It's like the Germans who tried to pretend they didn't know about the Holocaust or how bad it was after WWII.",

Much like in the Donbass a lot of effort was put into propaganda inside Crimea before and after annexation, which despite what ppl would like to believe about themselves is quite effective. Plus now that it's been almost 9 years there are people who grew up under annexation and propaganda in schools, at least some of them consider it Russian and they can now vote. 2. People were deported, pressured or left Crimea after the annexation e.g. Crimean Tatars, and Russian citizens would move there. The second issue could theoretically be dealt with cause you can track who moved there and when and who left, the first one I'm not so sure. If a referendum was held now and people voted to be a part of Russia I'm not sure how fair that would be considering the above, at the same time if ppl in Crimea indeed lean that way taking it back and integrating them back into Ukraine might be be a bit of a challenge. Maybe people don't care about it either way and just go about their lives, that would make things easier",

The idea that Ukraine voting itself away from Russia (well, the USSR) is all well and good and legitimate but Crimea voting for independence from Ukraine woudl be some rediculous thing is a nonsensical double standard.

Name a region where self-determination is a topic of contention and I can find you an example of the above. Furthermore, why would it only be a moral right given this vague list of reasons?\n\n>Mississippi cannot legally secede from the US even if 100% of voters in Mississippi agreed to do so. This was tested in 1861 and most people today agree that was terrible and illegitimate.\n\nThe reason Mississipi couldn't legally secede is because the US armed forces wouldn't let them, the US supreme court finding the seccession of Mississipi illegal is about tantamount to the Russian supreme court finding Crimea becoming a part of Russia again legal (Or the Brittish courts declaring the US colonies a part of Britain).

This completely flies in the face of video after video shown here and also we see how shocking morale is in the Russian forces with units complaining on almost a daily basis of losses, lack of training, conditions, everything and their wives and mothers have joined in. That is the reality. This journalist's article has done huge damage, because it has immediately been picked up by Russian Bots across the information space, trumpeting that the Washington Post admits that Ukraine is losing the war. The Paper's journalist might as well be a Russian Bot and his Ukrainian \"source\" is just as suspect. TURN THE BLOWTORCH on  the Washington Post.

It doesn't do anyone, including the Ukranians a service. They just demoted a beloved field commander because he felt the need to speak the truth on how severe losses are and to try and help the Ukrainians learn from their tactical mistakes. That's the level of propaganda Ukrainian leadership is pushing right now. They're willing to lose one of their most skilled leaders just to control a false narrative. Probably because they are scared of losing western support if we understood how tenuous the situation is for them, but high level leadership and strategy has not been looking great lately.",

During the Bush admin, Republicans were fanatically supportive of the Iraq war it because they viewed it as \"Babylon\", some epic historical region that validated the Christian-American right's sense of imperial destiny and their right to occupy the region.\n\nMany people have forgotten about how religiously fervent Republicans were in the early 2000's, believing they had a duty to protect the virgin purity of Christian America from those liberals who were turning America into a godless deviant. This religious fervor was taken to an extreme after the 9/11 attacks, which was done by Muslims who have a religious book that they read backwards and don't revere Jesus as the Alpha Prophet.\n\nThe pro-war fanaticism of the Republicans during that era was so pervasive it was impossible to stop when Democrats took power. So, if the Democrats were to warmonger, which they did, it was assured that the Republicans wouldn't do anything to stop the wars.\n\nThe Democrats, just coming out of the fanatical Bush years, were assured of their own righteousness, due to what they put up with from the righteous Republicans, so it was impossible to convince the Democrats they could be bad about anything, since it was true that Democrats were victimized by the Republicans.\n\nSo, under Obama, we had a situation where the Republicans were filled with massive pro-war momentum, and Democrats who were 100% certain of their victim-hood and therefore couldn't be evil, so when the same old corporations ordered the Democrats to do some warmongering, hardly anyone from either party even thought to stop them.\n\nSo yeah, I do see validity to the argument that opposing wars became nearly impossible after Obama took office.",

The whole point of this lie was to avoid defections from the Ukrainian military. When the entire western world united in this lie, the Ukrainian people believed it.\n\nI don't know what the men forced to the front lines think about Russia, for or against. But I would think that if they were expecting weak old men, maybe they thought it would be worse to try to defect then stay on the front lines, perhaps not even engaging in battle.\n\nWell, a huge number of Ukrainian men are now dead or disabled for life as a result of the lies that the western world leaders told. The words and actions of leaders have consequences.\n\nI think what's about to transpire is going to be epic.

    "content": "So many people in the U.S. and Europe have been led to believe that the Ukrainian military was super powerful while the Russian military was basically non-existent. The people of the western world believe that the Ukrainians keep winning on the battlefield and that the apparent \"static\" situation in Ukraine over the past 4-5 months means Russia has essentially lost this war.\n\nThe U.S. media told us all repeatedly just a few months ago that Russia was out of ammo, out of missiles, etc.\n\nIn fact, the past 4-5 months have been devastating to the Ukrainian military. The Russians are parked nicely in positions to massively overwhelm the Ukrainian troops with enormous numbers of artillery shells. The Ukrainians have been replenishing their front line losses with...more troops to be killed.\n\nWhat the people of the western world are about to realize is that all this time, the Ukrainian soldiers been getting blown to pieces by massive amounts of Russian artillery, and that all of the men willing to volunteer are already on the front lines, dead, or disabled for life.\n\nie - There are no more troops for the Ukrainian military.\n\nThere are multiple videos circulating online of angry Ukrainians yelling at the government for abducting men off the streets. This is being done because there aren't enough volunteers for the military. These abducted men are trained too quickly, the U.S. media reports 9 week training programs. These men are considered worthless so are the ones sent to the front to be killed.\n\nThe sleaziest of the Ukrainian military leadership stays back from the front lines, believing themselves to be too important to be killed, since they have abducted conscripts making up much of the military. This is a disaster for front line morale.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian drone strikes we keep hearing about in the media, I heard that the real plan by Russia is to keep the electric grid barely functioning, to spare civilians, but to deplete the Ukrainian materials supplies so that when the Russians feel like it, they can completely disable the electric over select regions for longer periods of time. \n\nThe Ukrainian anti-aircraft radars are electric-powered. When the electric grid goes down, so do the anti-aircraft systems in the area. They have to be powered by diesel, which there isn't really a ready supply for, so ad-hoc diesel generators are rushed in. But those create noise and heat that Russians have a way of detecting.\n\nThe massive depletion of Ukrainian military personnel has been occurring before the 300,000 Russian reserves are fully deployed.\n\nThe eastern part of Ukraine, the Donbas, produces something like 75% of Ukraine's national economic production. The rest, only about 25%. It's pretty obvious that the Russians are going to control the most valuable part of Ukraine, at least.\n\nSo, the situation is set up for a massive, irreversible move by the Russian military in Ukraine. I don't know how far the Russians are going to move in Ukraine. I think it's whatever they decide to do. \n\nThe people of the western world are going to see a massive movement of land going under Russian control and they're going to be asking what the hell just happened, because they all thought Ukraine was winning and the Russian soldiers are a joke.\n\nThis is where it gets epic.\n\nThe people of the western world are going to wonder how our leaders assessed the situation so wrongly. How did nobody see how effective the Russian military was and how ineffective the Ukrainian military was?\n\nPeople will eventually conclude that the western world leaders have been lying all this time.\n\nThis is where the fun starts.\n\nEdit: and about that 75% economic production of Ukraine in the Donbas. Over the longer term, if Russia decides to only take the valuable east and leave the burden of the west on the western world, the eastern half of Ukraine will have higher wealth per capita then before the war. Russia overall will have a higher wealth per capita. Western Ukraine will be an impoverished zone, supported only by unsustainable welfare programs from the United States. My god this is all so epic what's unfolding.",

Most nations in the world are on a trajectory to strengthen (aside from sustainability and mass extinction issues, which are whole other cans of worms to deal with), and most will.\n\nWhat's so epic is that the United States is desperately trying to prevent this strengthening of everyone else around the world, and the U.S., thankfully, is failing at it.\n\nBut the U.S. strategy to weaken the rest of the world, Russia included, involved farming and nurturing right wing fascist movements around the world, which included the Nazis of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is turning out to perhaps be the most important of America's fascist farms, as it becomes increasingly apparent how important Ukraine is for the world balance of powers.\n\nIt isn't just going to be Russia that is strengthened by Russia's victory there. It's everyone else outside of the United States and Europe. The reputation of the United States is going to be so tarnished after this, as will be that of the European Union and NATO, and the western militaries and economies so weakened, that the standing of \"the west\" will be reduced globally.\n\nI think we're all going to be better off as Russia consolidates control over what's left of Ukraine. The U.S. will no longer be able to wage bullshit wars like this again, especially with the long string of well-publicized lies to get the whole world involved into wars.\n\nPeople just aren't going to believe the United States anymore.\n\nI expect lots of whining and a huge sense of self-victimization for the rest of our lives in the U.S. media, as our \"leaders\" try to convince us to isolate ourselves from the influence of all these other, increasingly strong societies. Our media will train us to become more paranoid and fearful of all those \"others\" in the world, and many Americans will fall for it, especially the political right.\n\nI myself am not afraid of a multipolar world. I think that the newly-established balance of powers will make things more civilized and peaceful. We all need to focus on reconstructing our societies to be sustainable, and to reverse the current mass-extinction event and global warming catastrophes.\n\nI'm not looking forward to the upcoming decades of whining we're going to be hearing in the U.S. media which is the direct result of the U.S. and its NATO vassals losing the war in Ukraine.\n\nA man from Texas who's been fighting alongside the Donetsk militias since 2015, Russell \"Texas\" Bentley, has been saying, \"as goes Donbas, so goes the world\". I think he's correct in his assessment.\n\nThis is one of the most momentous and epic events we'll experience in our lifetimes. Geopolitical history is being decided right now. \n\nOh and I haven't even gotten into just what the history books are going to tell children about all these massive, epic lies the U.S. told about Ukraine throughout 2022 and into 2023, even all the controls over the Internet discourse.\n\nYou guys have really done a bang-up job there.

Even telling us that over 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine and this is something to celebrate and hope for more of.\n\nInterestingly, there's many of us who think that the U.S. and Ukrainian claims of Russian casualties are significantly exaggerated. So, while so many of the pro-USA, anti-Russian side have been celebrating mass killing of Russians, in fact, there haven't been nearly as many as claimed by the lying western media.\n\nThe Russians are deliberately trying to reduce casualties, both their own personnel as well as civilians, while inflicting massive casualties on the Ukrainian military, which is why they're so heavily reliant on a massive arsenal of artillery shells.\n\nThe irony in this whole situation is that the U.S.-led western world has been calling for massive deaths in Ukraine and encouraging us to celebrate mass killings or just turn a blind eye to them while Russia has been trying to avoid war, and it's the Ukrainian soldiers who've been getting obliterated in large numbers.\n\nI've already been told on Reddit that people want me dead, and these people run free and recklessly throughout Reddit unpunished or unstopped.

The U.S. could have spent trillions of dollars restructuring our society and investing in solar, geothermal, and fusion technologies. But the Democrats and Republicans agreed to blow $20 trillion on wars over the past 20 years instead.\n\nThis weakening of the United States, instead of being strengthened by the Green New Deal Act of 2003, has resulted in the current weak, debt-ridden, and still-not-sustainable society that we have today.\n\nRather than doing a Green New Deal today, we're spending over $100 billion on Ukraine, just so the U.S. can desperately hold on to world dominance.\n\nThe way to show strength right now is to pull out of Ukraine, and every other imperial war of the United States, and focus on solar, geothermal, and fusion technology developments, while also ending poverty in the United States.\n\nOh and that $31 trillion in debt has to be taken care of somehow. It's now about 1.5x of GDP. \n\nThe housing bubbles we experienced from 2001-2008 and then 2011 to a year ago have been all used up, so we can't raise funds by bubbling up housing prices anymore. Even the business press has published articles saying there are no more \"tricks\" the Federal Reserve can use to get us out of another crisis. This is why the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates now (and decreasing housing construction activity).\n\nTime's up for the United States. We're down to our last tricks. And all we're left with now are guns and Nazis to maintain dominance. It's a truly pitiful state of affairs for the United States.\n\nBut we can still invest some funds into geothermal, which I think has the most promise for returns on investments. All is not lost. I don't have any confidence in current leadership, though. They're all about spreading conspiracy theories about people discussing politics on the Internet and finding ways to support Nazi uprisings around the world.\n\nThe United States is going down in one of the most pitifully epic ways any society has ever gone down.

Maybe somewhere out there there are a handful of pacifists, but most people opposed to these wars by the United States are pretty badass and don't like being messed with.\n\nIt feels like warfare standing in opposition to these imperial wars, and many of us think of ourselves as established warriors. It definitely feels like war a lot. The Homeland Security fusion centers, the massive Internet surveillance and corporate trolls, the increasingly militarized police, the infiltration and hijacking of political groups. These are all militant acts by the United States government and various state and local governments against the people, violating the people's Constitutional rights.\n\nUsually, when I find people opposed to yet-another U.S. war, based yet-again on another obnoxious \"Big Lie\", they're usually pissed off and feeling pretty militant.\n\nI don't think you'll actually find a whole lot of pacifists at what are sometimes called \"anti-war\" rallies. A lot of the people want to put the bad guys from government and corporations into prison. These aren't pacifists. These are people looking for justice.",

There are a hundred million Russians backing this conflict and the leadership feels emboldened by this.\n\nThe nation has vast amounts of natural resources, manufacturing capabilities and willing or unwilling bodies to throw into this war for years to come.\n\nWhen WW2 started, Germany was not that strong, but once their wartime economy and war machine got motoring, they quickly turned into a very powerful force that rolled through much of Europe over a number of years and this was a nation with nowhere near enough natural resources to sustain their ambitious war effort.\n\nWithout doubt, the west is more powerful than Russia, but the west is not directly in this war and the west is made up of a range of democracies, all of which have their own internal values and power struggles over issues closer to home, like healthcare, cost of living, the environment and housing.\n\nIn short, the west has an awful lot to lose if this war escalates and Russia is dangerously close to putting themselves in a position where it is either a global escalation, or they get at least some of what they want.\n\nThere are very few paths towards the full liberation of Ukraine that don't involve a vastly increased chance of world war three kicking off.\n\nWe must handle things firmly but delicately and ensure that we are prepared for every eventuality.",

If you think India and china are going to help Russia defeat Nato and the west in general for a couple km of land Russia failed to grab in what should have been fairly easy in comparison I'd call you a fucking moron. China would literally undermine their own stance on sovereignty and it's stance on Taiwan and India is gonna do fuck all because there is absolutely nothing to gain and everything to lose. There won't be a fucking world war 3 as a result of this conflict unless china suddenly goes full fucking retard for literally no reason. While possible basically negligible. \n\nIf you think the west including america needs to be careful about Russia suddenly becoming a powerhouse able to compete  after what feels like 30 years of posturing and multiple conflicts a war in the middle of sanction package you are either know slot or stuff we don't or I'm overlooking something regarding Russia's current. If they were able to compete they fucking would. Because if you are willing to bomb doctors and children, poison people in foreign country and basically admit it or just start a fucking WAR OF CONQUEST, what is stopping you from going all out and instead getting humiliated over and over again and gain what basically amounts to nothing for tens of thousands of people dead while unrest starts to brew at the Homefront?",

Citing Germany&#039;s decision to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, he claimed history was repeating itself.\n\n> Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, the World War Two conflict which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops and turn the tide of the war.\n\n> Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia&#039;s invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he claims are leading the Kyiv government.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/10s01j3/80_years_on_we_are_facing_german_tanks_again_putin/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~672685 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Russia**^#1 **Putin**^#2 **Ukraine**^#3 **war**^#4 **modern**^#5",

He said his commitment to support Ukraine to victory and the fact he \"opened the door\" to tank deliveries last month showed this.\n\nMr Zelensky's Thursday visit to Brussels comes after he addressed the UK Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nThere, he also urged London to supply fighter jets to support Ukraine's war efforts.\n\n\"Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose,\" he told a crowd of MPs and peers in Westminster Hall, adding the UK was with his country on a march to \"the most important victory of our lifetime\".\n\nDowning Street said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft the UK could potentially offer, but emphasised this was \"a long-term solution\" and that training pilots could take years.\n\nRussia has warned there would be a \"response\" from Moscow if anyone did provide Ukraine with aircraft.",

    "content": "Fair to say, this doesn't add up. Hipkins is putting the blame on MHT, yet the OIA documents say Ukraine reached out once on the 16th of May, then again on the 1st of June.  Where in the documents did it say MHT reached out to Ukraine? This seems to be the key information missing, which Hipkins is using to deflect the issue on.\n\nThe version of events reported were that MHT received a request from Ukraine ‚Äì MHT put a proposal through to the government, the government then blocks the deal stating they don't have a framework for it. None of the information released states MHT reached out to Ukraine, then received requests for it, then put their proposal in and then had it blocked by NZ government.\n\nThis is all besides the point. The request should've gone through. [NZ is one of the lowest contributors in terms of what has been offered vs GDP.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1303432/total-bilateral-aid-to-ukraine/) Australia is significantly higher, geography has nothing to do with it. The only countries below us are neighbours of Ukraine (and they're managing the refugee situation ‚Äì something we're failing on, given multiple people have chosen to return to their war stricken country than stay here with the minimal support we offer) or they're countries aligning themselves with Russia ie India, China.  [We're one of the lowest in the world when it comes to providing useful aid.](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/) Blocking Russian assets and the diplomatic options taken elsewhere are no-brainers.\n\nBuilding a framework should've been fairly easy, and the money involved is less than what we've offered so far ‚Äì you can fulfill this order twice for the price of a single flag referendum. The idea that we would block it goes against our military and foreign affairs strategy, and given the money will be returned to the NZ economy, this should've been an attractive option. Their focus on delivering for ‚Äúimmediate needs‚Äù instead of actually helping with the long term humanitarian crisis that will come as a result of failing to act is short-sighted and quite frankly an appalling reason to reject the offer.\n\nThis seems to be more an issue with government and ministerial incompetence, and a lack of will power to defend global democracy, rather than an issue with costs or process. I do not see how Hipkins can defend this, and I am unsure how or why he is finicking around with this argument of using the process as an excuse. The greater good would've been providing the aid, approving the funding. Awful decision making. It really is.",
